Overview:
Anaphylaxis is a rapid, systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Nursing priorities are intramuscular epinephrine, airway support, and observation for biphasic response.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess cutaneous signs, airway compromise, respiratory distress, hypotension, and GI symptoms. Identify likely allergen exposure and timing.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor airway patency, SpOâ‚‚, BP, and symptom resolution after epinephrine. Track need for repeat dosing and fluid response.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer epinephrine promptly per protocol, provide oxygen and IV fluids, and assist with adjuncts after epinephrine. Prepare for airway management if deterioration occurs.

Patient Education:
Teach auto-injector use, trigger avoidance, and action plan steps. Arrange allergy follow-up for evaluation.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory hypotension, severe bronchospasm, or airway edema. Call for advanced airway or vasopressors as needed.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document time of epinephrine, doses, response, and observation duration. Coordinate prescription and training for auto-injector before discharge.

Prognosis:
Rapid epinephrine improves outcomes. Nursing observation mitigates biphasic risk.
