Overview:
Major depression impairs mood, energy, and function. Nursing care prioritizes safety assessment, adherence support, and activation of protective routines.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess mood, anhedonia, sleep, appetite, and concentration; screen for suicidality and comorbid anxiety or substance use. Use validated scales if available.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor activation or suicidality after medication starts or dose changes. Track adherence, side effects, and functional recovery.

Nursing Interventions:
Support structured daily routines, gentle physical activity, and sleep hygiene. Reinforce medication and therapy engagement; offer crisis resources.

Patient Education:
Explain time-to-effect for antidepressants, common side effects, and relapse warning signs. Encourage social reconnection and problem-solving strategies.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for active suicidal ideation/plan, psychosis, or inability to care for self. Arrange urgent psychiatric evaluation when needed.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document safety plans, contacts, and follow-up scheduling. Coordinate with therapists and primary care on care plans.

Prognosis:
Most improve with combined treatments; maintenance reduces relapse. Nursing continuity helps adherence and coping.
