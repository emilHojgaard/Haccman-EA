Purpose:
Provide an evidence-informed approach to acute migraine relief and prevention of medication overuse.

Scope:
For adults presenting with recurrent moderate to severe headaches with migrainous features.

Indications:
Unilateral throbbing pain with nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, or aura; activity worsens symptoms.

Diagnosis:
Clinical diagnosis based on recurrent attacks and associated features; exclude secondary causes with red flags or atypical aura. Assess disability and triggers.

Treatment/Management:
Use rapid-onset analgesics, antiemetics, and triptans when appropriate; consider gepants or ditans for specific populations. Provide rescue options and nonpharmacologic strategies.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track frequency and response with a headache diary; evaluate for preventive therapy if attacks are frequent or disabling. Educate on limiting acute medications to avoid rebound.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for status migrainosus, neurological deficits, or suspected secondary headache. Consider infusion therapy or specialist referral.

Safety Notes:
Avoid triptans in significant vascular disease and review pregnancy status. Screen for drug interactions with serotonergic agents.
