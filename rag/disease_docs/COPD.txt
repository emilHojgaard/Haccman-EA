TITLE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Overview:
COPD is a progressive lung condition (chronic bronchitis/emphysema) causing airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It leads to chronic cough, sputum production, and breathlessness.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Tobacco smoke (primary cause), biomass exposure
- Occupational dusts/chemicals, air pollution
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (rare)

Common Symptoms:
- Persistent cough with sputum, exertional dyspnea, wheeze
- Frequent bronchitis “flare-ups”

Diagnosis:
- Spirometry showing FEV1/FVC < 0.70 post-bronchodilator
- Assessment of severity (FEV1) and exacerbation history
- Chest X-ray/CT and oxygen saturation as indicated

Treatment:
- Bronchodilators (LAMA/LABA), inhaled corticosteroids for frequent exacerbations
- Pulmonary rehabilitation; vaccinations; oxygen if chronic hypoxemia
- Smoking cessation has the greatest impact on prognosis

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Inhaler technique checks; action plan for exacerbations
- Regular activity as tolerated; nutrition optimization

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Worsening breathlessness, purulent sputum, fever
- Low oxygen levels or confusion

Prognosis:
Progressive but manageable; stopping smoking and pulmonary rehab improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations.
