Responsible Department - Acute Medicine/ICU

Overview:
Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction from dysregulated infection response. Nursing care emphasizes rapid recognition, timely antibiotics, and hemodynamic support.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess for fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, altered mentation, and oliguria. Identify likely source through history and focused exam.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor lactate, urine output, mental status, and hemodynamics. Track antibiotic timing and fluid responsiveness.

Nursing Interventions:
Obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible without delay, administer antibiotics promptly, and give fluids per orders. Prepare for vasopressors and central access if hypotension persists.

Patient Education:
Explain infection source control and the need for monitoring. Provide family updates and discuss early mobilization when stable.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for persistent hypotension, escalating oxygen needs, or multiorgan dysfunction. Notify ICU for advanced monitoring or support.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record sepsis screening time, antibiotic start, fluid totals, and response. Coordinate source control procedures and consults.

Prognosis:
Early bundle adherence improves survival. Nursing timing and reassessment are critical to outcomes.
