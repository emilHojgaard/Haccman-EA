Subjective:
Thomas V. notes progressive exertional dyspnea and intermittent palpitations for 5 weeks, with reduced exercise capacity and occasional evening ankle swelling. Denies syncope or chest pressure but reports poor sleep and elevated stress.

Objective:
BP 167/105 mmHg, HR 91 bpm, RR 17/min. JVP not elevated. S4 present, no murmurs. Lungs clear; trace bilateral pitting edema. EKG reviewed at bedside appears consistent with left ventricular strain patterns.
Labs (today): ECG: voltage criteria for LVH with repolarization changes. NT-proBNP mildly elevated. Basic metabolic panel within normal limits; lipids show elevated LDL.

Assessment:
Long-standing hypertension with evidence of LVH and early congestive physiology. Symptoms likely reflect diastolic dysfunction; ischemia less likely but not excluded.

Plan:
- Titrate ACE inhibitor and add thiazide-like diuretic; salt restriction < 2 g/day; counsel weight reduction. Schedule transthoracic echocardiogram to assess wall thickness and diastolic function. Cardiology review in 3 weeks.
- Follow-up in 3 weeks as appropriate.

Signed,
Dr. L. Holm, Cardiology
