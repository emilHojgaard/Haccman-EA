Responsible Department - Respiratory/ID Unit

Overview:
Acute COVID-19 ranges from mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Nursing priorities include oxygen support, isolation, and monitoring for rapid decline.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess respiratory rate, SpOâ‚‚, cough, and fatigue; review risk factors for progression. Note onset timeline and exposure history.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor oxygenation trends, work of breathing, and fever. Track anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory therapy effects when used.

Nursing Interventions:
Titrate oxygen, encourage prone positioning when appropriate, and implement isolation precautions. Administer antivirals or steroids per orders and prevent VTE.

Patient Education:
Explain isolation, symptom monitoring, and home pulse oximetry if discharged. Reinforce vaccination and follow-up for persistent symptoms.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rising oxygen requirements, confusion, or hemodynamic instability. Notify ICU for high-flow or ventilatory support needs.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document oxygen devices and settings, escalation steps, and response to therapy. Coordinate discharge with clear return precautions.

Prognosis:
Prognosis varies with age and comorbidity; early support improves outcomes. Nursing surveillance detects deterioration promptly.
