TITLE: Breast Cancer

Overview:
Breast cancer arises from breast tissue cells and includes multiple subtypes with different behaviors and treatments. Early detection improves outcomes.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Age, family history/BRCA mutations
- Hormonal factors (early menarche, late menopause, HRT)
- Obesity, alcohol intake

Common Symptoms:
- Painless breast lump, skin dimpling, nipple changes or discharge
- Sometimes found on screening mammography

Diagnosis:
- Triple assessment: clinical exam, imaging (mammogram/ultrasound), core biopsy
- Staging with imaging as indicated; receptor status (ER/PR/HER2)

Treatment:
- Surgery (lumpectomy/mastectomy), radiotherapy
- Systemic therapy tailored to subtype: endocrine, chemotherapy, HER2-targeted agents
- Reconstruction and survivorship care

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Adherence to therapy and follow-ups
- Exercise, weight management, psychosocial support

When to Seek Medical Help:
- New lump, skin/nipple changes, persistent discharge

Prognosis:
Highly variable by stage and subtype; screening and modern therapy have improved survival significantly.
