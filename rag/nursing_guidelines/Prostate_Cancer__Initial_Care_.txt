Key Monitoring:
Monitor treatment side effects including urinary, bowel, and sexual function changes. Track adherence to appointments and labs.

Nursing Interventions:
Provide decision aids, set expectations for surveillance or definitive therapy, and coordinate referrals. Offer continence and sexual function resources.

Patient Education:
Explain risk categories, treatment options, and potential side effects. Discuss exercise, nutrition, and bone health if androgen deprivation is planned.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for severe pain, urinary retention, or neurological symptoms suggesting cord compression. Notify oncology for rapid PSA rise or systemic symptoms.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document preferences, consent discussions, and side-effect logs. Coordinate multidisciplinary meetings and survivorship planning.

Prognosis:
Prognosis varies by risk group; many localized cases have excellent outcomes. Nursing navigation improves experience and adherence.
