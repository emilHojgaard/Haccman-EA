Disease - Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

Responsible Department - Endocrinology Unit

Purpose:
Provide a consistent protocol for fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte replacement in adult DKA.

Scope:
For emergency and inpatient teams managing hyperglycemic crises in known or new diabetes.

Indications:
Polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue with hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis often precipitated by infection or insulin omission.

Diagnosis:
Identify hyperglycemia with elevated ketones and anion-gap metabolic acidosis; assess osmolality and triggers. Evaluate potassium before insulin administration.

Treatment/Management:
Begin isotonic fluids, correct potassium, and initiate continuous insulin once potassium is safe; address precipitating illness and transition to subcutaneous regimens after resolution.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor glucose, electrolytes, ketones, and anion gap; titrate insulin and fluids to steady correction. Educate on sick-day rules and outpatient follow-up.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory acidosis, shock, altered mental status, or severe electrolyte disturbances. Consider ICU care for frequent monitoring and insulin titration.

Safety Notes:
Avoid early insulin in hypokalemia to prevent arrhythmias. Prevent overly rapid correction of osmolality and watch for cerebral edema in at-risk patients.
