Subjective:
Katrine H., with longstanding type 2 diabetes and dietary nonadherence, reports two weeks of polydipsia, polyuria, and mid-afternoon fatigue. Admits to occasionally missing evening doses of metformin and increased intake of refined carbohydrates during social events. Denies chest pain, visual loss, or focal neurological symptoms.

Objective:
Vital signs: BP 145/98 mmHg, HR 95 bpm, Temp 36.9°C, SpO2 98% RA. BMI 33.1 kg/m². General: well-appearing, no acute distress. Cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable. Abdomen soft, non-tender. No peripheral edema; feet with intact sensation by monofilament.
Labs (today): Fasting glucose 14.9 mmol/L; HbA1c 9.1%; Creatinine 73 µmol/L with eGFR > 77 mL/min/1.73m²; urine albumin/creatinine ratio mildly elevated.

Assessment:
Suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with lifestyle and adherence factors predominating. No evidence of acute complications such as DKA or HHS. Concurrent hypertension requires continued monitoring and titration.

Plan:
- Reinforce metformin adherence; add SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 mg QD) given renal function and potential CV benefit. Dietician referral for structured meal planning; encourage daily brisk walking 25 min. Blood pressure log at home; consider ACE inhibitor uptitration if persistently > 140/90. Repeat HbA1c in 3 months; follow-up in 4 weeks or sooner if symptomatic.
- Follow-up in 3 weeks as appropriate.

Signed,
Dr. M. Rasmussen, Orthopedics
