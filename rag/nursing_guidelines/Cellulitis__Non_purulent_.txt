Overview:
Non-purulent cellulitis is diffuse bacterial skin infection, often streptococcal. Nursing care focuses on antibiotics, edema control, and portal-of-entry treatment.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess erythema, warmth, tenderness, and edema; evaluate interdigital maceration or tinea. Review systemic symptoms and allergy history.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor temperature and outline borders to assess spread. Track pain and function, and reassess within 48â€“72 hours.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer antibiotics as ordered, elevate the limb, and treat skin breaks. Provide analgesia and wound care.

Patient Education:
Teach skin hygiene, edema management, and footwear care. Explain when to return for worsening redness or fever.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapid progression, necrosis, or systemic toxicity. Consider alternative diagnoses if no improvement.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document lesion size, antibiotic timing, and education. Coordinate follow-up and community wound services if needed.

Prognosis:
Most cases respond quickly to therapy. Nursing border tracking helps verify improvement.
