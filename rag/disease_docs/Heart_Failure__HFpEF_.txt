TITLE: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)

Overview:
HFpEF features typical heart failure symptoms with a normal ejection fraction, commonly due to diastolic dysfunction in older adults with hypertension or metabolic syndrome.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Hypertension, obesity, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, aging
- Coronary disease and sleep apnea contribute

Common Symptoms:
- Exertional breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling
- Orthopnea (needing extra pillows), reduced exercise tolerance

Diagnosis:
- Echo (normal EF, diastolic dysfunction), elevated natriuretic peptides
- Assessment of comorbidities, volume status

Treatment:
- Diuretics for congestion; strict BP, diabetes, and weight control
- SGLT2 inhibitors show benefit; treat AF and sleep apnea

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Sodium restriction, daily weights, activity as tolerated
- Recognize fluid overload signs early

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Rapid weight gain, worsening breathlessness, syncope

Prognosis:
Variable; comorbidity management and lifestyle changes are central to outcomes.
