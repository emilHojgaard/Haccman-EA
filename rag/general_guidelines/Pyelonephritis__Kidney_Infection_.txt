Overview:
Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection that usually starts as a bladder infection and travels upward. It can make you feel very unwell and needs antibiotics.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Female anatomy, pregnancy, kidney stones, and urinary tract blockages raise risk. Catheters and diabetes also contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Fever, chills, back or side pain, nausea, and urinary symptoms such as burning or urgency.

Diagnosis:
Urine tests confirm infection; doctors may order blood tests or scans when complications are suspected.

Treatment:
Antibiotics are started promptly, sometimes in hospital if vomiting or severe illness is present. Pain relief and fluids help recovery.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Finish the full antibiotic course and drink plenty of fluids. Prevent future infections with good hydration and bladder habits.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help if fever persists beyond a couple of days of treatment or pain worsens. Pregnant people should seek care early.

Prognosis:
Most recover fully with treatment. Recurrent infections should be evaluated for underlying causes.
