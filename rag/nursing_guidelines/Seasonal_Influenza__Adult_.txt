Overview:
Seasonal influenza causes abrupt fever, myalgias, and respiratory symptoms. Nursing care focuses on supportive therapy, antiviral eligibility, and isolation.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess symptom onset timing, exposure history, and risk factors for complications. Evaluate for secondary pneumonia if relapse occurs.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor oxygenation, hydration, and temperature trends. Watch for myocarditis or encephalopathy in severe cases.

Nursing Interventions:
Provide antipyretics, fluids, and rest; administer antivirals when indicated by risk and timing. Implement droplet precautions.

Patient Education:
Counsel on isolation, hydration, and when to seek care. Reinforce annual vaccination.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypoxemia, severe dehydration, or decompensation of comorbid conditions. Consider admission for high-risk patients.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document symptom chronology, therapies given, and response. Coordinate follow-up and work/school guidance.

Prognosis:
Most recover in days to a week. Nursing support mitigates complications in vulnerable groups.
