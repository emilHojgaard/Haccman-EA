Disease - Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)
Date - 2025-07-31
Responsible Department - Cardiology

Overview:
HFrEF occurs when the heartâ€™s pumping ability is weakened, reducing blood flow to the body. Fluid can build up in the lungs and legs.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Prior heart attack, high blood pressure, heart valve disease, viral infections, and alcohol or drug toxicity are common causes.

Common Symptoms:
Breathlessness, fatigue, ankle swelling, and waking at night short of breath. Reduced exercise capacity is typical.

Diagnosis:
Echocardiogram measures reduced ejection fraction. Blood tests and ECG help identify causes and guide treatment.

Treatment:
Standard medicines (ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRA, SGLT2 inhibitors) improve symptoms and survival. Devices or procedures may be recommended for some people.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Daily weights, low-salt diet, medication adherence, and regular activity help control symptoms. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help for sudden weight gain, worsening swelling or breathlessness, fainting, or chest pain. Go to emergency care if symptoms escalate quickly.

Prognosis:
Outcomes have improved with modern therapy, especially when medicines are taken consistently and lifestyle changes are followed.
