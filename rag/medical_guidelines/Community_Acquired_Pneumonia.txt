Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Purpose:
Guide timely recognition, severity assessment, antimicrobial selection, and supportive care for adults with community-acquired pneumonia.

Scope:
Applies to adults presenting in outpatient clinics, emergency departments, or hospital wards with suspected lower respiratory infection.

Indications:
Acute cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, or sputum production, especially following viral illness or exposure.

Diagnosis:
Establish with compatible symptoms plus new infiltrate on chest imaging when feasible; use labs and microbiology selectively. Apply severity tools to inform site-of-care decisions and antibiotic route.

Treatment/Management:
Initiate empiric antibiotics based on local patterns and risk factors; de-escalate with culture data and clinical response. Provide oxygen for hypoxemia, antipyretics, fluids, and VTE prophylaxis for hospitalized patients as indicated.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Reassess clinical stability, oxygen needs, and adverse drug effects; convert to oral therapy once stable. Arrange follow-up imaging for high-risk patients or persistent symptoms.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for septic shock, respiratory failure, or rapidly progressive multilobar disease. Consider ICU evaluation for high severity scores or increasing oxygen requirements.

Safety Notes:
Review allergies and drug interactions when selecting antibiotics and ensure appropriate duration. Encourage early mobilization and aspiration risk mitigation in frail patients.
