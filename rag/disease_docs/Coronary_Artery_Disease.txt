TITLE: Coronary Artery Disease

Overview:
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is narrowing of the heartâ€™s arteries from atherosclerotic plaque, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially causing angina or heart attack.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- High LDL cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, smoking
- Older age, family history, chronic kidney disease
- Sedentary lifestyle, obesity

Common Symptoms:
- Central chest pressure or tightness with exertion (angina), radiating to arm, neck, or jaw
- Breathlessness, sweating, nausea during episodes
- Some people (especially with diabetes) have atypical symptoms

Diagnosis:
- Risk assessment, ECG, lab markers (lipids, glucose)
- Stress testing (ECG/imaging), coronary CT angiography
- Invasive angiography when indicated

Treatment:
- Antianginal therapy (beta-blockers, nitrates, CCBs)
- Antiplatelet therapy, statins, ACEi/ARB
- Revascularization (PCI/CABG) for suitable anatomy and symptom control
- Intensive risk-factor modification

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Regular aerobic activity as advised; cardiac rehab post-event
- Heart-healthy diet; weight and BP control; stop smoking

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Chest pain at rest or not relieved by usual medication
- Signs of heart attack (persistent pressure, sweating, nausea, breathlessness)

Prognosis:
Varies with extent of disease and risk-factor control; modern therapy substantially improves outcomes.
