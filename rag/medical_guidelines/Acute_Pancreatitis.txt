Purpose:
Standardize early diagnosis, supportive care, and complication surveillance in acute pancreatitis.

Scope:
For adults admitted with suspected pancreatitis related to gallstones, alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia, or medications.

Indications:
Sudden, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back with nausea and vomiting; risk factors include alcohol use and gallstones.

Diagnosis:
Establish with characteristic pain plus elevated pancreatic enzymes or imaging findings; evaluate severity and identify biliary etiology with ultrasound.

Treatment/Management:
Provide aggressive fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and early nutrition; treat biliary pancreatitis with timely ERCP when cholangitis or obstruction is present.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor vitals, urine output, and labs; assess for necrosis, infection, or organ failure. Plan cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis when clinically appropriate.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for organ failure, infected necrosis, or uncontrolled pain. Involve ICU, surgery, or interventional radiology for complications.

Safety Notes:
Avoid unnecessary antibiotics in sterile necrosis and limit excess fluids after initial resuscitation. Address alcohol cessation and triglyceride control to prevent recurrence.
