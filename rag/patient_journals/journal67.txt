Subjective:
Christian M. brought by family with 6 days of markedly reduced sleep, pressured speech, impulsive spending, and grandiosity. No substance use reported. Appetite variable; denies current suicidal intent.

Assessment:
Manic episode consistent with bipolar affective disorder; safety risk present due to impulsivity.

Plan:
- Initiate mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium with renal/thyroid monitoring) or atypical antipsychotic. Consider inpatient admission for stabilization if outpatient safety cannot be ensured. Coordinate psychoeducation with family.
- Follow-up in 6 weeks as appropriate.
