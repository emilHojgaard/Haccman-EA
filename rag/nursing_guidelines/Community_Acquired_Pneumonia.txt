Disease - Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Date - 2024-12-08
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Overview:
Community-acquired pneumonia presents with acute lower respiratory infection and radiographic infiltrate. Nursing care prioritizes oxygenation, fever control, early antibiotics, and mobilization.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess cough, sputum, pleuritic pain, fever, and dyspnea; evaluate respiratory pattern and accessory use. Review aspiration risk, vaccination status, and comorbidities.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor SpO₂, temperature curve, and respiratory rate; evaluate response to oxygen and antibiotics. Track fluid balance and delirium risk in older adults.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer prescribed antibiotics promptly, provide antipyretics, and titrate oxygen to targets. Encourage incentive spirometry and early ambulation when safe.

Patient Education:
Explain antibiotic adherence, hydration, and airway clearance strategies. Reinforce vaccination and smoking cessation to reduce recurrence.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for worsening hypoxemia, persistent tachypnea, hypotension, or confusion. Seek urgent review if sepsis criteria develop or oxygen needs rise quickly.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document oxygen delivery, SpO₂, temperatures, and antibiotic timing. Coordinate follow-up imaging or visits for high-risk patients.

Prognosis:
Most patients recover with timely therapy; frail or comorbid patients have higher complication risk. Nursing mobilization and hydration reduce deconditioning.
