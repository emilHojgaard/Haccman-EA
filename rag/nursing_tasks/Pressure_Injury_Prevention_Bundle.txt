Contraindications:
No absolute contraindications; individualize positioning in spinal instability or pain.

Equipment:
Risk assessment tool, repositioning schedule, support surfaces, protective dressings, moisturizers, incontinence supplies.

Procedure Steps:
Screen on admission and daily; reposition on schedule; optimize moisture control and nutrition; offload heels and bony prominences. Document bundle adherence.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Audit skin checks, device-related pressure points, and adherence to repositioning. Track any stage changes promptly.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain repositioning importance and encourage participation. Discuss cushions and offloading at home after discharge.

Escalation:
Escalate for nonblanchable erythema, skin breakdown, or device-related pressure. Involve wound care specialists for staging and management.
