TITLE: Epilepsy

Overview:
Epilepsy is a tendency to have unprovoked, recurrent seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Types and triggers vary.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Structural brain changes, genetic causes, prior head injury or stroke
- CNS infections, developmental conditions

Common Symptoms:
- Focal symptoms (tingling, jerking, déjà vu) or generalized convulsions
- Post-ictal confusion, fatigue

Diagnosis:
- Clinical history, witness accounts, EEG
- MRI brain to look for structural causes; labs to exclude mimics

Treatment:
- Anti-seizure medications tailored to seizure type
- Surgery or neuromodulation for refractory cases; trigger avoidance (sleep deprivation, alcohol)

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Medication adherence; seizure diary
- Safety planning (driving restrictions per law, water safety)

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Prolonged seizure (>5 minutes) or repeated seizures without recovery (status epilepticus, emergency)
- New neurological deficits

Prognosis:
Many achieve seizure freedom with medication; some require specialized care.
