Task - Oral Nutrition Support for Patients with Reduced Appetite
Date - 2023-01-14
Responsible Department - Nursing / Nutrition Support

Purpose:
Provide evidence-based strategies to help patients with reduced appetite meet their nutritional needs and prevent malnutrition.

Scope:
Applies to adult inpatients or residents with decreased oral intake but a functional swallowing ability. Excludes patients requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition.

Indications:
Reduced oral intake, unintentional weight loss, fatigue or illness affecting appetite, or increased nutritional requirements.

Contraindications:
Severe dysphagia, gastrointestinal obstruction, or medically indicated NPO (nil per os) status. In these cases, consider enteral feeding per policy.

Equipment:
Meal intake record, patient preference list, oral supplements, fortified foods, and adaptive utensils as needed.

Procedure Steps:
1. Assess current intake and identify barriers to eating (e.g., nausea, taste changes, fatigue).
2. Encourage small, frequent meals and energy/protein-dense foods.
3. Offer preferred and culturally appropriate foods where possible.
4. Provide oral nutritional supplements between meals if prescribed.
5. Encourage social or assisted mealtimes to increase intake.
6. Collaborate with the dietitian if intake remains inadequate after 48–72 hours.
7. Document interventions and patient response daily.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Track oral intake, weight, hydration status, and tolerance to fortified foods or supplements. Document progress and escalate if nutritional goals are unmet.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain the importance of nutrition, small frequent meals, and the use of supplements. Involve family in encouraging intake and meal preparation when appropriate.

Escalation:
If the patient’s intake remains insufficient despite interventions, or there are signs of malnutrition or weight loss, escalate to the dietitian or physician to assess for enteral feeding initiation.

Safety Notes:
Monitor for swallowing difficulty, aspiration risk, and supplement intolerance. Maintain upright positioning during and after meals.
