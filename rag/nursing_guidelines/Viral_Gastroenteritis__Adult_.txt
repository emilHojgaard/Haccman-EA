Overview:
Viral gastroenteritis causes acute nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Nursing care emphasizes hydration, electrolyte safety, and infection control.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess volume status, frequency of vomiting/diarrhea, and exposure history. Screen for red flags such as severe tenderness or blood in stool.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor hydration markers, electrolytes when indicated, and urine output. Track fever and tolerance of oral intake.

Nursing Interventions:
Encourage oral rehydration solutions and administer antiemetics judiciously. Implement contact precautions and support gradual diet advancement.

Patient Education:
Teach hand hygiene, safe food practices, and rehydration strategies. Provide return precautions for dehydration signs.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, or immunocompromised status. Initiate IV fluids if oral rehydration fails.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document stool and emesis frequency, intake/output, and education provided. Coordinate work/school notes and follow-up if needed.

Prognosis:
Most cases resolve within days. Nursing hydration guidance reduces ED returns.
