Labs (today): ECG: atrial fibrillation; TSH and electrolytes to evaluate contributors. CHADS-VASc assessed.

Assessment:
New-onset atrial fibrillation—hemodynamically stable; requires rate control and thromboembolic risk assessment.

- Begin rate control (beta-blocker as appropriate), evaluate need for anticoagulation, cardiology follow-up for rhythm strategy.
- Follow-up in 4 weeks as appropriate.
