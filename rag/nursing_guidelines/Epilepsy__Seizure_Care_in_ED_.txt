Responsible Department - Neurology

Overview:
Emergency seizure care centers on airway protection and timely termination of convulsions. Nursing care ensures safety, medication delivery, and post-ictal monitoring.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess seizure type, duration, injuries, and medication adherence. Check glucose and pregnancy status where relevant.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor airway, SpOâ‚‚, and hemodynamics during and after events. Track post-ictal recovery and recurrence.

Nursing Interventions:
Protect from injury, position laterally, and administer benzodiazepines per protocol; load antiseizure meds if ordered. Avoid restraining limbs and ensure suction availability.

Patient Education:
Reinforce adherence, trigger avoidance (sleep deprivation, alcohol), and rescue plan use. Provide driving and safety counseling per local rules.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for status epilepticus, persistent altered consciousness, or trauma. Notify ICU for refractory seizures needing continuous EEG.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document timings, meds, responses, and injuries. Coordinate neurology follow-up and medication reconciliation.

Prognosis:
Many patients achieve control with therapy. Nursing adherence support reduces recurrence risk.
