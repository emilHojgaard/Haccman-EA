Date - 2023-04-14
Responsible Department - Nutrition Support / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Safely initiate and maintain enteral feeding to meet nutritional goals while preventing aspiration and tube complications.

Scope:
For nurses managing adult enteral feeds on wards and step-down units. Applies to NG and gastrostomy devices.

Indications:
Inadequate oral intake with a functional GI tract, dysphagia, or neurological impairment requiring tube feeding.

Contraindications:
GI obstruction, severe ileus without decompression, or high-risk aspiration without mitigation. Defer if hemodynamically unstable.

Equipment:
Feeding pump or gravity set, prescribed formula, water for flushes, pH strips where applicable, syringes, securement, PPE.

Procedure Steps:
Confirm tube placement per policy, elevate head of bed 30–45°, start feeds at ordered rate, and perform scheduled water flushes. Titrate rate as tolerated and maintain tube patency.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Monitor tolerance (abdominal discomfort, residuals per policy, stool pattern), hydration, and weight trends. Record intake and any adverse events.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain feed goals, positioning, and the importance of not altering pump settings. Teach tube care and when to call for help.

Escalation:
Escalate for aspiration signs, persistent vomiting, high residuals per policy, or tube displacement. Hold feeds and notify the prescriber.

Safety Notes:
Maintain head elevation during and after feeds; verify placement regularly. Use clean technique for handling formula and tubing to reduce infection.
