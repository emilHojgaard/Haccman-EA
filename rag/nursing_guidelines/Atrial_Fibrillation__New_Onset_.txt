Disease - Atrial Fibrillation (New Onset)
Date - 2024-10-12
Responsible Department - Cardiology Unit

Overview:
New-onset atrial fibrillation can cause palpitations and hemodynamic instability. Nursing care prioritizes rate control safety, anticoagulation checks, and symptom relief.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess hemodynamic stability, chest discomfort, dyspnea, and fatigue. Review precipitating illness, thyroid status, alcohol intake, and medication history.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor telemetry, BP, and heart rate response to therapy; observe for bleeding if anticoagulated. Track symptom change with rate control or cardioversion plans.

Nursing Interventions:
Prepare for rate control medications and potential cardioversion; maintain NPO as ordered. Educate on anticoagulation rationale and precautions.

Patient Education:
Discuss triggers, stroke risk, and adherence to anticoagulants when indicated. Provide guidance on heart rate monitoring and activity limits until stabilized.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypotension, chest pain, syncope, or pre-excited AF patterns. Notify cardiology for rapid deterioration or failed rate control.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document rhythm strips, medication timing, and responses. Coordinate anticoagulation counseling and outpatient rhythm evaluation.

Prognosis:
Many patients stabilize with rate or rhythm control. Nursing education reduces recurrence triggers and embolic events.
