Responsible Department: Pulmonology Unit

1. Purpose
Guide diagnosis, assessment, and management of COPD in adults.

2. Scope
Physicians in primary care, respiratory clinics, and inpatient settings.

3. Indications
Persistent respiratory symptoms and fixed airflow limitation in smokers/ex-smokers.

4. Diagnosis
- Spirometry: post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70.
- Grade airflow limitation (GOLD); assess exacerbation risk and symptoms (CAT/mMRC).
- Exclude asthma, bronchiectasis; evaluate comorbidities.

5. Treatment/Management
- Smoking cessation; vaccinations; pulmonary rehab.
- Bronchodilators: LAMA or LABA; escalate to dual LAMA/LABA; add ICS in eosinophilic or frequent exacerbators.
- Exacerbation: controlled O₂ (SpO₂ 88–92% if CO₂ retainer), bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics if bacterial signs; consider NIV.

6. Monitoring & Follow-up
- Exacerbation prevention; inhaler technique; rehab adherence; oxygen assessment.

7. When to Escalate
- Acute respiratory failure, refractory hypercapnia, hemodynamic instability.

8. Safety Notes
- Caution ICS in pneumonia-prone; optimize bone health, diabetes control.
