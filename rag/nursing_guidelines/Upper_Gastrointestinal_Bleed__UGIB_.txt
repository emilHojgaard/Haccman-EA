Document Information:
Disease - Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed (UGIB)
Date - 2025-02-04
Responsible Department - Gastroenterology

Overview:
UGIB presents with hematemesis or melena and can be life-threatening. Nursing care emphasizes resuscitation, transfusion safety, and endoscopy coordination.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess hemodynamics, stool color, and bleeding history including anticoagulants or NSAIDs. Evaluate comorbid liver disease.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor vitals, orthostatics, hemoglobin trends, and mental status. Track transfusions and response to therapy.

Nursing Interventions:
Establish large-bore IV access, administer fluids and PPIs as ordered, and prepare for endoscopy. Position appropriately and manage aspiration risk.

Patient Education:
Explain fasting, procedure steps, and medication adjustments. Counsel on avoiding NSAIDs and alcohol if relevant.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for persistent hypotension, ongoing bleeding, or variceal suspicion. Notify the team for massive transfusion protocols.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record estimated blood loss, transfusion details, and endoscopy timing. Coordinate with endoscopy unit and anesthesia.

Prognosis:
Outcomes depend on source and comorbidity; early endoscopy improves control. Nursing resuscitation limits complications.
