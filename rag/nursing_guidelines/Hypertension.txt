Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Cardiology Unit

Overview:
Hypertension is persistently elevated BP increasing CV/renal risk. Nursing priorities: accurate measurement, adherence support, lifestyle counseling, and recognition of hypertensive urgency/emergency.

Nursing Assessment:
- Proper BP technique (seated, rested, correct cuff, both arms initially).
- Review meds, side effects (cough, dizziness), salt intake, sleep, alcohol, activity.
- Check end-organ symptoms: chest pain, neuro deficits, vision changes, dyspnea.

Key Monitoring:
- BP logs (home/ambulatory if available); orthostatics if dizziness/falls.
- Renal function/potassium if on ACEi/ARB/diuretic (per orders).

Nursing Interventions:
- Reinforce adherence, timed dosing, and refills; address barriers.
- Counsel: salt restriction, weight loss, activity, limit alcohol; sleep hygiene.
- Administer prescribed antihypertensives; recheck BP post-dose per protocol.

Patient Education:
- BP goals and self-monitoring; recognizing red flags; medication side effects/what to do.

When to Escalate:
- BP ≥180/120 with symptoms (neuro, chest pain, SOB) → emergency pathway.

Documentation & Coordination:
- BP trends, counseling provided, adverse effects, and communication with prescriber.

Prognosis:
Most reach targets with combined lifestyle and meds; sustained nursing support improves adherence.
