Abrupt onset of watery diarrhea, cramping, nausea, and low-grade fever, often with sick contacts or foodborne exposure.

Diagnosis:
Clinical diagnosis is typical; reserve stool testing for severe, persistent, or outbreak-related illness. Assess volume status and exclude red flags like bloody stool or severe tenderness.

Treatment/Management:
Emphasize oral rehydration and early diet advancement; use antiemetics and antidiarrheals judiciously. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and prolonged symptoms; counsel on hygiene to reduce transmission. Provide return precautions for worsening pain or fever.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for severe dehydration, intractable vomiting, or immunocompromised hosts with persistent symptoms. Consider IV fluids and further evaluation.

Safety Notes:
Avoid antimotility agents in suspected dysentery or toxin-mediated illness. Reinforce hand hygiene and safe food practices.
