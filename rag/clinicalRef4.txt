Stable Angina

History:
Episodes of exertional chest discomfort, relieved by rest. 
No recent increase in frequency or severity. No rest pain.

Examination: 
Normal cardiac auscultation. Blood pressure moderately elevated. No signs of heart failure.

Investigations: 
ECG with nonspecific ST-T changes, unchanged from prior. Lipid profile elevated. 
Stress test positive in past.

Assessment: 
Stable angina with reasonable control on current regimen. Risk factors partially managed.

Asthma â€“ Clinical Reference Summary

Definition:
Chronic inflammatory airway disorder with reversible airflow obstruction and hyperresponsiveness.

Epidemiology:
Often begins in childhood, though adult-onset is possible. Prevalence varies by region and exposure to allergens.

Pathophysiology:
Eosinophilic inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity, mucus overproduction, airway remodeling.

Clinical Features:
Wheezing, cough (especially nocturnal), dyspnea, chest tightness. Triggers include allergens, exercise, infections, environmental irritants.

Investigations:

Spirometry with bronchodilator response.

Peak expiratory flow monitoring.

Allergy testing if indicated.

Treatment / Management:

Relievers: Short-acting beta-agonists (salbutamol).

Controllers: Inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide, fluticasone), long-acting beta-agonists in combination therapy.

Other: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast) for adjunct therapy.

Monitoring: Symptom diary, inhaler adherence, lung function tests.

Key Points:
Regular therapy and trigger management reduce exacerbations and hospital visits.
