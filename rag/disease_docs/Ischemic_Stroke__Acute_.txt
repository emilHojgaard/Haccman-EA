Disease - Ischemic Stroke (Acute)
Date - 2025-09-18
Responsible Department - Neurology/Stroke

Overview:
An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel supplying the brain is blocked, causing brain cells to lose oxygen. Fast treatment can limit damage.

Causes and Risk Factors:
High blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, smoking, and carotid artery disease raise risk. Prior stroke or TIA increases chances.

Common Symptoms:
Sudden weakness or numbness on one side, facial droop, trouble speaking or understanding, vision problems, or loss of balance.

Diagnosis:
A brain scan (CT or MRI) distinguishes stroke types and guides therapy. Blood tests and heart rhythm checks look for causes.

Treatment:
Some people are eligible for clot-busting medicine or a procedure to remove the clot. Blood pressure, sugar, and temperature are carefully managed.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
After stabilization, rehab helps regain strength and speech. Controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and rhythm problems lowers future risk.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Call emergency services immediately if symptoms start â€” time lost is brain lost. Do not wait to see if symptoms improve.

Prognosis:
Recovery varies by stroke size and location; early treatment and rehab improve outcomes.
