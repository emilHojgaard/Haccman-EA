Overview:
Migraine is a recurring headache disorder that can cause throbbing pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light or sound. Attacks can be disabling.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Family history, hormonal changes, stress, lack of sleep, and certain foods may trigger attacks. Triggers vary widely.

Common Symptoms:
One-sided throbbing headache, nausea or vomiting, and sensitivity to light and noise. Some people experience an aura before pain.

Diagnosis:
Doctors diagnose migraine by patterns of symptoms and exam. Scans are rarely needed unless red flags exist.

Treatment:
Pain relievers, triptans, or anti-nausea medicines are used for attacks. Preventive medicines or devices may reduce frequency.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Keep a headache diary to identify triggers, maintain regular sleep and meals, and manage stress. Limit use of acute medicines to avoid rebound.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help for very severe or new-type headaches, neurological symptoms, or headaches that do not respond to usual treatment.

Prognosis:
Migraine tends to come and go over a lifetime, but many people achieve good control with treatment and trigger management.
