Purpose:
Standardize initial stabilization, seizure termination, and secondary evaluation for adults with active seizures or recent events.

Scope:
For emergency clinicians managing convulsive seizures or post-ictal patients.

Indications:
Generalized tonic-clonic activity, focal seizures with impaired awareness, or recurrent events without full recovery.

Diagnosis:
Prioritize airway and glucose; obtain targeted labs and consider imaging when new abnormalities or trauma are suspected. Review triggers, medications, and adherence.

Treatment/Management:
Use a stepwise benzodiazepine-first approach and load antiseizure medication if needed; treat underlying precipitants. Provide counseling on driving restrictions and safety.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for recurrent seizures and medication adverse effects; arrange neurology follow-up and EEG as indicated. Address adherence barriers and rescue plans.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for status epilepticus, persistent altered consciousness, or focal deficits. Involve critical care for refractory seizures and continuous EEG needs.

Safety Notes:
Avoid excessive sedation with repeated benzodiazepine dosing. Check interactions between antiseizure drugs and concurrent therapies.
