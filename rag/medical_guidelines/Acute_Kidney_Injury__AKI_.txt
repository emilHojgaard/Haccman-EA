Disease - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Nephrology

Purpose:
Provide a structured approach to identifying etiology and reversing acute kidney injury.

Scope:
For inpatient and emergency care where sudden creatinine rise or oliguria is detected.

Indications:
Abrupt decline in kidney function with reduced urine output, often in sepsis, volume depletion, or nephrotoxin exposure.

Diagnosis:
Classify prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal mechanisms through exam, labs, urinalysis, and imaging for obstruction. Review medications for nephrotoxins and dose adjustments.

Treatment/Management:
Restore perfusion with fluids when indicated, remove nephrotoxins, and treat underlying causes. Use renal replacement therapy for standard indications.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor fluid balance, electrolytes, acidâ€“base status, and drug levels for renally cleared agents. Plan follow-up to reassess recovery and adjust long-term therapy.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, or uremic complications. Involve nephrology early if etiology is unclear or severe.

Safety Notes:
Avoid contrast and NSAIDs where possible and correct doses for GFR. Use cautious fluid strategies in heart failure and cirrhosis.
