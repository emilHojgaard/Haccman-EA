Disease - Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)

Responsible Department - Vascular Medicine

Overview:
DVT is thrombus formation in deep veins, typically of the legs. Nursing care focuses on anticoagulant safety, ambulation guidance, and PE prevention.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess unilateral swelling, pain, warmth, and dilated superficial veins. Review recent immobility, surgery, hormone therapy, or cancer history.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor for new chest symptoms suggestive of PE and watch for bleeding on therapy. Track limb circumference and pain changes.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer anticoagulants as prescribed, encourage ambulation as tolerated, and apply compression for symptoms if ordered. Educate on leg elevation and hydration.

Patient Education:
Explain medication adherence and bleeding precautions, including when to seek help. Discuss prevention during travel and periods of immobility.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for suspected PE, phlegmasia, or severe pain and swelling. Seek urgent review for contraindications or complications of therapy.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document anticoagulant timing, patient response, and education delivered. Coordinate duration planning and specialty referral when needed.

Prognosis:
Most patients improve with anticoagulation; recurrence risk persists without addressing provoking factors. Nursing education reduces complications.
