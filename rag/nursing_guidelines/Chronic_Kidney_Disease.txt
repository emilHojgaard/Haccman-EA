TITLE: Chronic Kidney Disease – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Nephrology Unit

Overview:
CKD is progressive loss of kidney function. Nursing priorities: BP/diabetes support, medication safety, anemia/bone-mineral monitoring, and patient education.

Nursing Assessment:
- Fluid status (edema), BP, weight; review nephrotoxic exposures (NSAIDs).
- Labs trend awareness: eGFR, K⁺, bicarbonate, ACR (per orders).

Key Monitoring:
- BP logs; symptoms of uremia (nausea, pruritus), hyperkalemia (weakness).
- Medication dose adjustments with declining eGFR.

Nursing Interventions:
- Reinforce ACEi/ARB adherence (if albuminuria), SGLT2i where prescribed.
- Dietary sodium/potassium guidance (per dietitian); fluid balance recording when needed.

Patient Education:
- Avoid NSAIDs; medication review; vaccination schedule; when to seek help.

When to Escalate:
- Rising K⁺, fluid overload/respiratory distress, confusion, rapidly rising creatinine.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Vitals, weights, education, adverse effects; coordinate with nephrology/dietitian.

Prognosis:
Progression can be slowed with strict risk-factor control and medication adherence.
