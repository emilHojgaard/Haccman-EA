Overview:
Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that causes redness, warmth, and swelling. It usually affects one area of a limb.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Breaks in the skin, athlete’s foot, edema, and obesity raise risk. Diabetes and poor circulation contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Spreading redness, tenderness, warmth, and sometimes fever. The border may be hard to define.

Diagnosis:
Doctors diagnose cellulitis based on the skin’s appearance and symptoms. Tests are rarely needed unless severe.

Treatment:
Antibiotics treat the infection; elevation and pain relief speed recovery. Treating skin breaks or fungal infections prevents recurrence.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Keep the area clean and raised when possible. Wear supportive footwear and moisturize dry skin to reduce cracking.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help if redness spreads quickly, you develop a fever, or pain worsens. Go urgently if the infection is near the eye or genital area.

Prognosis:
Most cases improve within a few days of antibiotics. Recurrent cellulitis may need preventive steps.
