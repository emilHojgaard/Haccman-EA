Overview:
Anaphylaxis is a severe, rapid allergic reaction that can affect breathing and blood pressure. It is a medical emergency.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Foods, insect stings, and medicines are common triggers. People with prior reactions are at higher risk.

Common Symptoms:
Hives, swelling of lips or tongue, wheezing, shortness of breath, vomiting, and dizziness or fainting.

Diagnosis:
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and timing after exposure to a likely trigger. No test can confirm it during the emergency.

Treatment:
Epinephrine (adrenaline) is given immediately and may be repeated. Oxygen, fluids, and other medicines support recovery.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Carry an epinephrine auto-injector if prescribed and learn how to use it. Work with an allergy clinic to identify triggers and create an action plan.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Use epinephrine and call emergency services at once if you have trouble breathing, swelling of the tongue, or feel faint after exposure.

Prognosis:
Most people recover quickly with prompt treatment. Avoiding triggers and carrying rescue medicine are key to safety.
