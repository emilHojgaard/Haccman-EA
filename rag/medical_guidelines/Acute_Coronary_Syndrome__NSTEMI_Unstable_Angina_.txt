Purpose:
Standardize early risk stratification, antithrombotic therapy, and timely angiography for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes.

Scope:
For clinicians in emergency and inpatient cardiology managing adults with suspected ischemic chest pain without persistent ST elevation.

Indications:
Chest discomfort, pressure, or dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion, often with risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, or prior CAD.

Diagnosis:
Obtain serial high-sensitivity troponins and ECGs and assess risk scores to guide invasive strategy. Exclude mimics such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism when red flags exist.

Treatment/Management:
Initiate antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, beta-blockers as appropriate, and high-intensity statins. Coordinate early invasive evaluation for high-risk features and address contributing anemia, infection, or tachyarrhythmia.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor telemetry, symptoms, hemodynamics, and bleeding risk; adjust antithrombotics with renal function. Plan cardiac rehab and risk factor modification on discharge.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for recurrent pain, hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmias, or dynamic ECG changes. Consult interventional cardiology for urgent angiography if deterioration occurs.

Safety Notes:
Verify antiplatelet contraindications and recent anticoagulant use. Use nitrates cautiously in suspected right ventricular infarction or severe aortic stenosis.
