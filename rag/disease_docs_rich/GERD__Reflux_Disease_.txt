TITLE: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

Overview:
GERD is reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus causing heartburn and regurgitation. Chronic reflux may inflame the esophagus and disrupt sleep and quality of life.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Weak lower esophageal sphincter, hiatal hernia
- Obesity, late-night meals, alcohol, caffeine, smoking
- Pregnancy; certain medications

Common Symptoms:
- Heartburn after meals, sour/bitter taste
- Night symptoms, chronic cough or hoarseness

Diagnosis:
- Clinical response to acid suppression; endoscopy if alarm features
- pH monitoring/manometry for refractory cases

Treatment:
- Proton pump inhibitor for 4â€“8 weeks; step-down as controlled
- Lifestyle: weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, avoid triggers
- Surgery/endoscopic options for selected refractory cases

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Smaller meals; avoid lying down within 3 hours of eating
- Limit alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, peppermint, fatty meals

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Dysphagia, GI bleeding, weight loss, persistent vomiting
- Persistent symptoms despite optimal therapy

Prognosis:
Excellent with lifestyle and acid suppression; maintain the least intense regimen that controls symptoms.
