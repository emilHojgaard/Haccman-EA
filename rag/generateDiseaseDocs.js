            "Causes and Risk Factors":
                "Family history of asthma or allergies, exposure to dust mites, pollen, pets, smoke, and air pollution increase risk. Viral infections and cold air can also trigger attacks.",

            "Treatment":
                "Reliever inhalers quickly open the airways for symptoms, while preventer inhalers reduce inflammation over time. Some people need combination inhalers or add-on medicines if symptoms persist.",
            "Self-Management and Lifestyle":
                "Use a written action plan, practice correct inhaler technique, and avoid triggers such as smoke. Warm up before exercise and keep vaccinations up to date.",
            "When to Seek Medical Help":
                "Seek help if you need your reliever more than a few times a week, or if breathing is difficult and you cannot speak full sentences. Call emergency services for blue lips, severe breathlessness, or no response to reliever.",
