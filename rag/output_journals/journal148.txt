Subjective:
Rune F. presents with sudden severe colicky flank pain radiating to the groin, associated with nausea and restlessness. No dysuria or fever reported.

Objective:
Uncomfortable, pacing; CVA tenderness on affected side; abdomen soft. Vitals stable.
Labs (today): Urinalysis: microscopic hematuria; non-contrast CT suggests distal ureteric stone 4 mm.

Assessment:
Renal colic from ureteric calculus—likely to pass spontaneously if ≤ 5–6 mm.

Plan:
- NSAID analgesia and antiemetic; tamsulosin may aid passage; hydration advice. Urology referral if obstruction, infection, or uncontrolled pain.
- Follow-up in 3 weeks as appropriate.

Dr. S. Aaen, Allergy & Immunology
