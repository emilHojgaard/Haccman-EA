Disease - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Pulmonology Unit

Purpose:
Standardize evaluation of airflow limitation, symptom burden, and exacerbation risk in COPD while guiding inhaled therapy and acute care.

Scope:
Intended for adult patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and a smoking or exposure history across primary care, emergency, and inpatient settings.

Indications:
Progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production in adults with tobacco use or significant biomass/occupational exposure.

Diagnosis:
Post-bronchodilator spirometry showing FEV1/FVC below the fixed ratio supports COPD; assess severity by FEV1 and symptom tools. Evaluate for cardiovascular disease, bronchiectasis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when appropriate.

Treatment/Management:
Use long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA) tailored to symptoms and exacerbations; add inhaled corticosteroids for frequent exacerbations with eosinophilia. Manage exacerbations with short-acting bronchodilators, controlled oxygen, systemic steroids, and antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track exacerbations, rescue medication use, and exercise tolerance; optimize vaccinations and pulmonary rehabilitation. Counsel smoking cessation and inhaler technique at each visit.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, persistent hypoxemia, or repeated exacerbations despite maximal inhaled therapy. Consider noninvasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, or referral for advanced interventions.

Safety Notes:
Avoid excessive oxygen targets to reduce CO2 retention risk. Watch for pneumonia when initiating ICS and assess osteoporosis with prolonged steroid exposure.
