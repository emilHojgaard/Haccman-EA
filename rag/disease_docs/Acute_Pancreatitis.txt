Overview:
Acute pancreatitis is sudden inflammation of the pancreas that causes severe upper tummy pain. Most cases improve with hospital care and rest.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Gallstones and alcohol are the most common causes. High triglycerides and some medicines can also trigger it.

Common Symptoms:
Severe upper abdominal pain that may spread to the back, nausea, and vomiting. Pain often worsens after eating.

Diagnosis:
Blood tests for pancreatic enzymes and imaging help confirm the diagnosis and look for causes. Doctors also assess severity.

Treatment:
Fluids, pain control, and careful feeding support recovery. Gallstone-related cases may need procedures to clear the duct.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Avoid alcohol and follow dietary advice during recovery. Manage cholesterol and gallbladder issues to prevent recurrence.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent help for severe pain, fever, or vomiting that does not settle. Report yellowing of the eyes or skin.

Prognosis:
Most cases are mild and resolve in days; severe cases may have complications and take longer.
