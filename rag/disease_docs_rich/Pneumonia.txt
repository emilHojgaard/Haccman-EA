Causes and Risk Factors:
- Older age, chronic diseases (COPD, heart failure, diabetes)
- Smoking, alcohol misuse, weakened immunity

Common Symptoms:
- Fever, chills, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain
- Breathlessness, fatigue

Diagnosis:
- Chest X-ray (consolidation), bloods (WBC, CRP)
- Severity scoring (e.g., CURB-65) to guide setting of care

Treatment:
- Empirical antibiotics per guideline (pathogen/host risk)
- Fluids, antipyretics, oxygen as needed; early mobilization

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Rest and hydration; complete antibiotics
- Vaccination (influenza, pneumococcal) and smoking cessation

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Worsening breathlessness, confusion, persistent fever
- Poor oral intake or signs of sepsis

Prognosis:
Usually good with prompt treatment; higher risk in frail or comorbid patients.
