Disease - Heart Failure (Acute Decompensation)

Responsible Department - Cardiology Unit

Overview:
Acute decompensated heart failure causes congestion and hypoperfusion symptoms. Nursing priorities are diuresis support, fluid balance, and recognition of hemodynamic instability.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, weight change, and urine output. Evaluate lung sounds, JVP surrogates, skin perfusion, and presence of S3 or crackles.

Key Monitoring:
Track strict intake/output, daily weights, electrolytes, and renal function. Monitor vital signs and tele for arrhythmias during diuresis or vasodilator therapy.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer loop diuretics as ordered, reinforce sodium/fluid limits, and position upright. Support oxygen therapy and assist with vasodilators per protocol.

Patient Education:
Teach daily weights, low-sodium diet, and when to seek care for rapid gain or swelling. Review medication adherence and follow-up plans.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypotension, declining urine output, new confusion, or refractory hypoxemia. Notify cardiology for suspected shock or chest pain suggestive of ischemia.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record diuretic dosing, outputs, electrolyte changes, and patient education. Coordinate discharge planning with heart failure clinic.

Prognosis:
Outcome improves with guideline therapy and early follow-up. Nursing surveillance helps prevent readmission and fluid overload.
