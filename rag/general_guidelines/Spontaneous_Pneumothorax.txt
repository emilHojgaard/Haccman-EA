Disease - Spontaneous Pneumothorax
Date - 2025-06-09
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED

Overview:
A pneumothorax is air trapped between the lung and chest wall, causing part of the lung to collapse. It can occur without an injury in otherwise healthy people or those with lung disease.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Tall, slim young adults and smokers are at higher risk for primary cases. Underlying lung diseases such as COPD raise risk for secondary cases.

Common Symptoms:
Sudden sharp chest pain and shortness of breath on one side. Some feel only mild discomfort.

Diagnosis:
A chest X-ray or ultrasound confirms the diagnosis. A CT scan may be used when the picture is unclear.

Treatment:
Small, stable pneumothoraces may resolve with observation and oxygen. Larger or more symptomatic cases may need aspiration or a small chest drain.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Avoid air travel and diving until cleared. Stop smoking to reduce recurrence risk.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek emergency help for worsening breathlessness, severe chest pain, or fainting. Report increasing symptoms after initial treatment.

Prognosis:
Many cases resolve fully, but recurrences can occur. Surgery may be suggested after repeated episodes.
