TITLE: Rheumatoid Arthritis

Overview:
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease causing persistent, symmetric joint inflammation, leading to pain, swelling, and potential joint damage.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Genetic susceptibility (HLA-DRB1), smoking
- Female sex, hormonal and environmental factors

Common Symptoms:
- Morning stiffness >30 minutes, small joint swelling (hands/feet)
- Fatigue, low mood, reduced grip strength
- Extra-articular features (nodules, dry eyes/mouth)

Diagnosis:
- Clinical pattern; rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies
- Inflammatory markers; ultrasound/MRI for synovitis
- Exclude other inflammatory arthritides

Treatment:
- Early DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate) are key; add biologics/targeted agents if needed
- Short steroid courses for flares; NSAIDs for symptoms
- Vaccination and infection risk counseling

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Joint protection strategies, physiotherapy/occupational therapy
- Smoking cessation; exercise tailored to tolerance

When to Seek Medical Help:
- New hot swollen joints; medication side-effects (e.g., infection, liver issues)

Prognosis:
Early, treat-to-target therapy greatly reduces disability and joint damage.
