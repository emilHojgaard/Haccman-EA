Overview:
A DVT is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can cause swelling and pain and may lead to a lung clot if untreated.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Recent surgery, immobility, pregnancy, cancer, hormones, and prior clots raise risk. Long flights can contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Leg swelling, pain, warmth, and redness, usually on one side. Some clots cause few symptoms.

Diagnosis:
Doctors assess risk and use an ultrasound scan to look for a clot. Blood tests may help in low-risk cases.

Treatment:
Blood thinners are the main treatment. Compression and walking help symptoms once therapy is started.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Wear compression if advised, keep moving, and follow medication instructions carefully. Know bleeding precautions.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent help for chest pain, sudden breathlessness, or coughing blood. Report severe leg pain or swelling that worsens.

Prognosis:
Most clots resolve with treatment, though some people develop long-term leg swelling. Preventing future clots is key.
