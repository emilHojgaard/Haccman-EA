TITLE: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Cardiology Unit

Overview:
HFpEF presents with heart failure symptoms but normal EF, often due to diastolic dysfunction. Nursing focus: volume assessment, diuresis support, comorbidity management, and self-care coaching.

Nursing Assessment:
- Symptoms: exertional dyspnea, orthopnea/PND, edema, fatigue.
- Weight trends, fluid/salt intake; comorbidities (HTN, AF, DM, obesity, OSA).
- Vitals, JVP, lung crackles, ankle edema; daily weights.

Key Monitoring:
- Response to diuretics (urine output, weight loss goal ~0.5–1 kg/day if fluid overloaded).
- Electrolytes/renal function per orders; BP/HR control.

Nursing Interventions:
- Sodium/fluid restriction education; administer diuretics as prescribed.
- Optimize positioning (upright); oxygen if hypoxic; encourage gentle activity.
- Reinforce adherence to SGLT2i/antihypertensives; sleep apnea pathway if applicable.

Patient Education:
- Daily weights (report 2 kg in 3 days), edema checks, low-salt diet, meds adherence.

When to Escalate:
- Rapid weight gain, worsening SOB at rest, hypotension, confusion, oliguria.

Documentation & Coordination:
- I/O, daily weights, symptoms, education; handover to HF nurse/cardiology clinic.

Prognosis:
Variable; tight comorbidity control and self-management reduce admissions.
