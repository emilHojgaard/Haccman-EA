Subjective:
Lars G. brought by family with 7 days of markedly reduced sleep, pressured speech, impulsive spending, and grandiosity. No substance use reported. Appetite variable; denies current suicidal intent.

Objective:
Agitated but cooperative; speech rapid, tangential at times. Affect expansive; insight limited; judgment impaired in spending decisions.
Labs (today): Toxicology screen negative; CMP and CBC within normal limits.

Assessment:
Manic episode consistent with bipolar affective disorder; safety risk present due to impulsivity.

Plan:
- Initiate mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium with renal/thyroid monitoring) or atypical antipsychotic. Consider inpatient admission for stabilization if outpatient safety cannot be ensured. Coordinate psychoeducation with family.
- Follow-up in 5 weeks as appropriate.
