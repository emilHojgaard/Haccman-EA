Purpose:
Provide a framework for timely diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of acute pyelonephritis.

Scope:
For adults with systemic features of urinary tract infection in outpatient and inpatient settings.

Indications:
Fever, flank pain, nausea, and urinary symptoms such as dysuria or frequency; costovertebral angle tenderness is typical.

Diagnosis:
Obtain urinalysis and urine culture; consider imaging for obstruction, stones, or treatment failure. Assess pregnancy status and recent instrumentation.

Treatment/Management:
Start empiric antibiotics based on local resistance patterns and narrow when culture results return; ensure hydration and analgesia. Consider hospitalization for sepsis, vomiting, or complicating conditions.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Reassess symptoms within 48â€“72 hours and adjust therapy if not improving; monitor renal function when using nephrotoxic agents. Arrange follow-up cultures in selected high-risk patients.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for septic shock, obstruction with hydronephrosis, or persistent fever despite therapy. Coordinate urgent urologic drainage when obstruction is present.

Safety Notes:
Check allergies and pregnancy before antibiotic selection and avoid fluoroquinolones when risks outweigh benefits. Encourage hydration and counsel on recurrence prevention.
