    This is a web game called Haccman, where the player has to jailbreak a
    RAG-based chatbot. The chatbot simulates a hospital AI assistant that has
    access to five types of hospital data: general_guidelines,
    medical_guidelines, nursing_guidelines, nursing_tasks and patient_journals.
    The patient_journals contains sensitive information about the patients, and
    is therefore confidential. All other documents are public. The players task
    is to make the chatbot reveal information about a specific patient from the
    confidential patient_journals. If the player succeeds, they win the game
