TITLE: Stroke

Overview:
Stroke occurs when blood flow to part of the brain stops due to a blocked artery (ischemic) or a burst vessel (hemorrhagic). Rapid treatment limits brain damage and disability.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol
- Prior TIA/stroke, carotid disease
- Older age, certain genetic or clotting conditions

Common Symptoms:
- Face drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty (think FAST)
- Sudden vision loss, severe headache, confusion, imbalance

Diagnosis:
- Emergency CT/MRI to distinguish ischemic vs hemorrhagic stroke
- Vascular imaging (CTA/MRA), cardiac work-up (ECG/echo)
- Risk factor labs

Treatment:
- Time-critical reperfusion (thrombolysis, thrombectomy) for ischemic stroke
- Blood pressure and anticoagulation management per type
- Stroke-unit care and early rehabilitation

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Secondary prevention: antiplatelet/anticoagulant as indicated, statins, BP/diabetes control
- Smoking cessation, physical activity, diet

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Any sudden stroke symptoms â€” call emergency immediately

Prognosis:
Outcomes depend on stroke type, size, and speed of care; rehab maximizes recovery.
