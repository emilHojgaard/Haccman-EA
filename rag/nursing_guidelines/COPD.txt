TITLE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Pulmonology Unit

Overview:
COPD causes persistent airflow limitation. Nursing focus: inhaled therapy adherence, exacerbation management, oxygen safety, smoking cessation support, pulmonary rehab linkage.

Nursing Assessment:
- Cough/sputum, dyspnea scale, exacerbation frequency.
- SpO₂ at rest/exertion; inhaler technique; smoking status.

Key Monitoring:
- SpO₂ targets 88–92% if CO₂ retainers (per plan); signs of infection/exacerbation.

Nursing Interventions:
- Administer bronchodilators ± ICS per plan; controlled oxygen.
- Breathing techniques (pursed-lip), energy conservation; sputum clearance coaching.

Patient Education:
- Inhaler technique, vaccination, smoking cessation programs, pulmonary rehab.

When to Escalate:
- Worsening hypoxia, confusion, severe breathlessness, poor response to therapy.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Observations, meds given, education; liaise with respiratory team.

Prognosis:
Progressive but manageable; cessation and rehab improve QoL.
