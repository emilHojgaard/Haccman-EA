Overview:
Sepsis is a life-threatening reaction to infection that can damage organs. Early recognition and treatment save lives.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Any infection can lead to sepsis, including pneumonia, urinary, and abdominal infections. Older age, weak immunity, and chronic illness increase risk.

Common Symptoms:
Fever or low temperature, fast heart rate, fast breathing, confusion, extreme weakness, or low urine output.

Diagnosis:
Doctors use blood tests, cultures, and scans to find the infection and measure organ function. They monitor blood pressure and oxygen closely.

Treatment:
Antibiotics and fluids are started urgently; oxygen and medications to support blood pressure may be needed. Source control (like draining an abscess) is important.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Complete all antibiotics as prescribed and attend follow-ups. Ask about vaccines and ways to reduce future infection risk.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent help for confusion, very fast breathing, severe chills, or dizziness, especially if you recently had an infection.

Prognosis:
Sepsis is serious but outcomes improve with early treatment. Recovery may take weeks, and fatigue is common afterward.
