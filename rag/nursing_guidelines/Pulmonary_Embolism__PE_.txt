Document Information:
Disease - Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
Date - 2025-03-03
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Overview:
Pulmonary embolism is acute obstruction of pulmonary arteries causing hypoxemia and strain. Nursing care supports oxygenation, anticoagulation safety, and rapid risk escalation.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess sudden dyspnea, pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, or syncope; review recent immobility, surgery, cancer, or prior VTE. Evaluate calf symptoms and oxygen needs.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor SpOâ‚‚, hemodynamics, and pain; observe for bleeding on anticoagulation. Track signs of right heart strain such as hypotension or rising lactate.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer anticoagulants as ordered and maintain oxygen to target. Prepare for thrombolysis or catheter therapy if high-risk features develop.

Patient Education:
Teach anticoagulant adherence, bleeding precautions, and activity guidance. Discuss provoking factors and prevention strategies for travel and immobility.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypotension, worsening hypoxemia, or syncope. Activate PE response pathways per local policy.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document oxygen settings, anticoagulant dose/times, and symptom trends. Coordinate follow-up for duration planning and risk assessment.

Prognosis:
Risk varies with clot burden and comorbidity; early therapy improves outcomes. Nursing monitoring mitigates bleeding and deterioration.
