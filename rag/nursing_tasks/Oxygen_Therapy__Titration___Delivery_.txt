Responsible Department: Respiratory / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Provide safe initiation and titration of supplemental oxygen to meet prescribed SpO₂ targets.

Scope:
Nurses initiating/adjusting oxygen per protocol.

Indications:

Contraindications:
- Not for breathlessness alone without hypoxemia
- Use caution in CO₂ retainers (target 88–92% unless otherwise ordered)

Equipment:
- Oxygen source, nasal cannula or masks, pulse oximeter, humidification if indicated

Procedure Steps:
- Baseline SpO₂; apply device; titrate flow to target saturation.
- Reassess frequently during changes; document device, flow, and SpO₂.

Monitoring & Documentation:
- Continuous/regular SpO₂; respiratory rate/effort; ABGs if ordered.
- Record adjustments and patient response.

Patient Education:
- Device care, safety (no smoking/open flames), when to call for help.

Escalation:
- Worsening hypoxia, increased work of breathing, reduced consciousness.

Safety Notes:
- Use appropriate fire safety; humidify if high flows per policy.
