Task - Oxygen Therapy (Titration & Device Selection)
Date - 2023-04-24
Responsible Department - Respiratory / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Deliver and titrate oxygen to achieve ordered saturation targets while minimizing harm such as CO₂ retention.

Scope:
For adult inpatients requiring supplemental oxygen in ward or ED settings. Includes nasal cannula, simple masks, and venturi systems.

Indications:
Hypoxemia from respiratory or cardiac illness, perioperative needs, or palliative dyspnea relief.

Contraindications:
No absolute contraindications; use caution in CO₂ retainers and flammable environments. Follow fire safety policies strictly.

Equipment:
Oxygen source, appropriate delivery interface, humidification if required, pulse oximeter, signage, and PPE.

Procedure Steps:
Assess baseline saturations and clinical status, choose device, and titrate flow to ordered target. Reassess after changes and document device and settings.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Monitor SpO₂, work of breathing, and comfort; check skin integrity at contact points. Record flow, device, and response each round.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain goals, safety near heat sources, and avoiding smoking. Teach not to adjust settings without staff.

Escalation:
Escalate for persistent hypoxemia, rising distress, or suspected CO₂ retention (drowsiness). Consider high-flow or NIV per local pathway.

Safety Notes:
Use lowest flow that maintains targets and secure tubing to prevent falls. Confirm oxygen points are shut off when discontinued.
