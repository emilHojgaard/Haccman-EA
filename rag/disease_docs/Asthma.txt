TITLE: Asthma

Overview:
Asthma is a long-term condition in which the airways become inflamed and overly sensitive. Triggers such as viral colds, allergens, smoke, or exercise can narrow the airways, making it harder to breathe. Symptoms often occur in episodes and can vary from mild to severe over time.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Family or personal history of asthma, eczema, or hay fever (atopy)
- Allergen exposure (dust mites, pollen, mold, pets)
- Tobacco smoke, air pollution, occupational irritants
- Viral infections, particularly in childhood
- Cold air, exercise, strong emotions or stress

Common Symptoms:
- Wheezing (especially on exhalation), shortness of breath, chest tightness
- Night or early-morning cough
- Symptoms provoked by allergens, infections, or activity

Diagnosis:
- Clinical history and exam
- Spirometry to confirm variable airflow limitation; bronchodilator response testing
- Peak flow monitoring; bronchoprovocation testing if needed
- Consider allergy testing to identify triggers

Treatment:
- Reliever inhalers (short-acting bronchodilators) for quick symptom relief
- Preventer inhalers (inhaled corticosteroids) to reduce airway inflammation
- Combination inhalers (ICS/LABA) for persistent symptoms
- Add-on therapies (LAMA, leukotriene antagonists, biologics) in moderate–severe disease
- Vaccinations: influenza and pneumococcal per guidance

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Personalized asthma action plan and regular technique checks
- Identify and minimize triggers; smoke-free home
- Pre-exercise reliever if recommended; warm-ups and cool-downs
- Peak flow or symptom diary to track control

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Needing reliever more than 2–3 times per week
- Worsening breathlessness, difficulty speaking full sentences
- No response to reliever or signs of severe attack (blue lips, drowsiness)

Prognosis:
With consistent controller therapy and trigger management, most people achieve excellent control and live fully active lives.
