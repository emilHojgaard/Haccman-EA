Overview:
AF is an irregular heart rhythm that can cause a fast pulse and raise the risk of stroke. Some people feel palpitations; others have no symptoms.

Causes and Risk Factors:
High blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, alcohol, and age increase risk.

Common Symptoms:
Palpitations, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, tiredness, or lightheadedness. Some people notice only reduced stamina.

Diagnosis:
An ECG confirms AF; monitors may be used to capture intermittent episodes. Blood tests and an echo look for causes.

Treatment:
Treatment focuses on controlling heart rate or restoring rhythm and preventing stroke with blood thinners when appropriate.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Limit alcohol, treat sleep apnea, and exercise regularly. Take medicines as prescribed and track pulse if advised.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent care for severe chest pain, fainting, or sudden worsening breathlessness. Report unexplained bleeding when on blood thinners.

Prognosis:
Many live well with AF when stroke risk is addressed and symptoms are controlled.
