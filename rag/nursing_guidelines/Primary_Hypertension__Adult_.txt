Responsible Department - Internal Medicine

Overview:
Primary hypertension is sustained blood pressure elevation without secondary cause. Nursing focus is confirmation, lifestyle support, and safe medication titration.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess repeated readings with correct cuff and positioning; review medications, sleep apnea risk, and lifestyle factors. Screen for symptoms suggesting end-organ damage.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor home and clinic BP logs, electrolytes, and renal function with dose changes. Watch for orthostatic hypotension in older adults.

Nursing Interventions:
Reinforce diet, exercise, and adherence strategies; assist with home BP technique and targets. Support gradual medication adjustments per plan.

Patient Education:
Teach the importance of consistent measurement, salt reduction, weight control, and sleep hygiene. Discuss medication effects and side effects to expect.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypertensive emergency signs or refractory hypertension on combination therapy. Refer for secondary causes when indicated.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document baseline risk factors, readings, and education provided. Coordinate pharmacist or nutrition referrals and follow-up schedules.

Prognosis:
Most patients achieve control with lifestyle and medications. Nursing reinforcement improves adherence and cardiovascular risk reduction.
