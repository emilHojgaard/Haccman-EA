Present Illness:
   - Maja Jensen reports fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and occasional lightheadedness.
- History of Present Illness
   - Maja Jensen notes weeks of progressive tiredness and exertional dyspnea. Diet is low in iron-rich foods; denies obvious bleeding but reports intermittent dyspepsia with NSAID use. No black stools observed at home.
- Physical Examination
   - Pale conjunctivae; soft systolic flow murmur; no focal deficits. Vitals stable (BP 101/91 mmHg, HR 64 bpm). Abdomen soft, non-tender.
- Diagnostics (Today)
   - Hb low with microcytosis, low ferritin, and reduced transferrin saturation. Stool testing and GI evaluation considered if no dietary cause identified.
- Assessment
   - Microcytic anemia most consistent with iron deficiency; source evaluation warranted (dietary vs occult GI blood loss).

Plan:
   - Start oral iron with vitamin C; discuss GI side effects and adherence strategies (alternate-day dosing if needed).
   - Review NSAID exposure and consider gastroprotection or alternatives.
   - Arrange GI work-up if poor response or red flags emerge (e.g., melena, weight loss).
- Follow-up & Disposition
   - Recheck Hb and ferritin in 6 weeks; earlier review if symptoms worsen.

Patient Education & Safety Net:
Explain expected timeline for symptom improvement and iron store repletion. Advise on iron-rich foods and to seek care for black stools, severe dizziness, or chest pain.
