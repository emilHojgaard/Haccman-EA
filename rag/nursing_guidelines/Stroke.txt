Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Neurology Unit

Overview:
Stroke is acute focal neurological deficit from ischemia or hemorrhage. Nursing priorities: time-critical recognition, airway/breathing/circulation support, swallow screening, early mobilization, secondary prevention.

Nursing Assessment:
- FAST symptoms onset time; neuro checks (NIHSS if trained), vitals, glucose.
- Screen swallow before oral intake; aspiration risk.

Key Monitoring:
- Neuro status q1–4h per protocol; BP (often permissive in ischemic stroke initially), SpO₂, temperature, glucose.

Nursing Interventions:
- Positioning, aspiration precautions; maintain normoglycemia/normothermia.
- DVT prophylaxis, pressure area care; early rehab involvement.
- Education: risk factors, adherence to antiplatelet/anticoag per plan, statins.

Patient Education:
- FAST recognition, medication adherence, lifestyle modification.

When to Escalate:
- Acute neuro deterioration, airway compromise, fever, uncontrolled BP, seizure.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Onset times, neuro observations, swallow screen, therapy involvement, family updates.

Prognosis:
Depends on type/size and time to treatment; rehab and prevention are crucial.
