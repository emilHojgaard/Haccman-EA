Purpose:
Provide a pragmatic pathway for diagnosis confirmation, cardiovascular risk reduction, and medication titration in primary hypertension.

Scope:
For outpatient management and emergency confirmation when severe asymptomatic elevations are encountered.

Indications:
Repeated elevated office or home readings without a secondary cause, often accompanied by headaches or no symptoms at all.

Diagnosis:
Confirm with out-of-office measurements or ambulatory monitoring; evaluate secondary causes based on age and clinical clues. Assess global risk, renal function, and electrolytes.

Treatment/Management:
Implement lifestyle measures and initiate first-line agents such as thiazide diuretics, ACEi/ARB, or calcium channel blockers; tailor to comorbidities. Avoid rapid blood pressure reduction in stable, asymptomatic patients.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Review home BP logs, adherence, and adverse effects; titrate medications to targets over weeks. Reinforce diet, activity, and sleep hygiene.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypertensive emergencies with acute end-organ damage or refractory hypertension on combination therapy. Consider specialty referral for secondary workup.

Safety Notes:
Monitor electrolytes and renal function after dose changes and be cautious with dual reninâ€“angiotensin blockade. Assess pregnancy potential before ACEi/ARB use.
