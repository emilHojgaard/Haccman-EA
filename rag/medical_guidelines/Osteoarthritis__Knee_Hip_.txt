Responsible Department - Rheumatology

Purpose:
Provide symptom control strategies and functional optimization for degenerative joint disease of the knee or hip.

Scope:
For outpatient management with referral for advanced therapy when conservative measures fail.

Indications:
Activity-related joint pain, stiffness after rest, and crepitus with reduced range of motion; imaging shows joint space narrowing and osteophytes.

Diagnosis:
Clinical assessment supported by plain radiographs when needed; exclude inflammatory arthritis or referred pain. Evaluate gait, strength, and assistive device needs.

Treatment/Management:
Use exercise therapy, weight management, topical/oral analgesics, and intra-articular injections as appropriate. Consider arthroplasty for severe, refractory disability.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track pain, function, and medication tolerance; reinforce exercise adherence. Revisit surgical candidacy if quality of life declines despite optimized care.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapid functional decline, severe night pain, or failure of conservative therapy. Refer to orthopedics for advanced options.

Safety Notes:
Limit chronic NSAID use in high-risk patients and protect gastric and renal function. Counsel on safe activity progression to prevent falls.
