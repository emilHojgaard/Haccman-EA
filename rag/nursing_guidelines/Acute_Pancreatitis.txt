Overview:
Acute pancreatitis presents with severe epigastric pain and elevated enzymes. Nursing care focuses on fluids, analgesia, and early complication surveillance.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess pain radiation to the back, nausea/vomiting, and risk factors such as alcohol use or gallstones. Evaluate volume status and abdominal tenderness.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor vitals, urine output, and pain control; track labs including electrolytes and hematocrit. Watch for hypoxia and infection signs.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer isotonic fluids per protocol, provide multimodal analgesia, and support early enteral nutrition when ordered. Prepare for ERCP if biliary obstruction is suspected.

Patient Education:
Counsel on alcohol cessation and gallstone management plans. Explain dietary progression and the importance of follow-up.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for organ failure, persistent vomiting, or uncontrolled pain. Notify team for suspected necrosis or sepsis.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document fluid totals, pain scores, nutrition status, and procedures performed. Coordinate surgical or GI consults as needed.

Prognosis:
Most mild cases resolve with supportive care; severe cases carry complication risk. Nursing vigilance detects deterioration early.
