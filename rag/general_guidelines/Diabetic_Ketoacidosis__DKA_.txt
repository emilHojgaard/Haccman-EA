Overview:
DKA is a serious complication of diabetes where the body runs out of insulin, leading to high sugar, dehydration, and acid buildup. It requires urgent treatment.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Infections, missed insulin doses, faulty pumps, or new-onset diabetes are common triggers. Dehydration and certain medications can contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Thirst, frequent urination, nausea, abdominal pain, deep breathing, and drowsiness. Breath may smell fruity.

Diagnosis:
Blood tests show high sugar, acid in the blood (ketones), and electrolyte changes. Doctors look for the trigger as well.

Treatment:
Fluids, insulin, and careful electrolyte replacement are given in hospital. The underlying trigger is treated at the same time.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Follow sick-day rules, check ketones when unwell, and never stop insulin without advice. Keep supplies and backup plans ready.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent care for high sugars with vomiting, positive ketones, or signs of dehydration. Do not delay.

Prognosis:
Most people recover fully with prompt treatment. Preventing future episodes depends on education and access to supplies.
