Overview:
COPD is a lung condition that makes it harder to breathe over time due to narrowed airways and damage to air sacs. It commonly affects people with a history of smoking or long-term exposure to fumes.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Cigarette smoking is the main cause. Other risks include biomass fuel exposure, dusts and chemicals at work, and rare genetic conditions.

Common Symptoms:
Breathlessness on exertion, chronic cough, and mucus production. Flare-ups may cause sudden worsening of breathing.

Diagnosis:
Spirometry confirms persistent airflow limitation. Doctors also assess symptom burden and flare-up history.

Treatment:
Daily inhalers help open the airways and reduce flare-ups; some people benefit from pulmonary rehab and oxygen therapy. Vaccinations and stopping smoking are key parts of care.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Stop smoking, stay active, and practice breathing techniques. Keep rescue medicines available and have a plan for flare-ups.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Get urgent help for worsening breathlessness, chest pain, lips turning blue, or confusion. Call promptly if your usual medicines are not helping.

Prognosis:
Symptoms can be managed and quality of life improved with treatment and rehab, though the condition is long-term.
