Document Information:
Disease - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
Date - 2023-12-09
Responsible Department - Nephrology

Overview:
AKI is an abrupt decline in renal function that may be prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal. Nursing priorities include volume optimization, nephrotoxin avoidance, and electrolyte safety.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess fluid status, urine output, medications, and potential obstruction. Review recent illness, contrast exposure, and sepsis indicators.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor intake/output, electrolytes (especially potassium), acidâ€“base status, and weight. Track response to fluids or diuretics when used.

Nursing Interventions:
Hold nephrotoxins as ordered, administer fluids judiciously, and prepare for renal replacement therapy if indicated. Support safe medication dosing.

Patient Education:
Explain AKI causes, avoidance of NSAIDs, and follow-up labs. Discuss hydration targets and when to return for worsening symptoms.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, or uremic signs. Notify nephrology if etiology is unclear or severe.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document fluid balances, lab changes, and medication adjustments. Coordinate follow-up creatinine checks after discharge.

Prognosis:
Many cases recover if causes are reversed. Nursing vigilance prevents electrolyte complications.
