Overview:
Osteoarthritis causes degenerative joint pain and functional limitation. Nursing care promotes analgesia safety, exercise adherence, and fall prevention.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess pain pattern, stiffness after rest, mobility aids, and impact on ADLs. Evaluate gait and home safety risks.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor pain/function scores, response to therapies, and medication side effects. Track weight and activity goals.

Nursing Interventions:
Support exercise therapy referrals, teach joint protection techniques, and coach on topical/oral analgesic use. Encourage heat/cold modalities as appropriate.

Patient Education:
Educate on weight management, pacing activities, and safe footwear. Discuss when to consider injections or surgery.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapidly worsening function, night pain, or falls. Refer to orthopedics when conservative care fails.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document mobility aids, home safety recommendations, and therapy attendance. Coordinate PT and community resources.

Prognosis:
Symptoms fluctuate but are manageable with multimodal care. Nursing coaching improves quality of life and independence.
