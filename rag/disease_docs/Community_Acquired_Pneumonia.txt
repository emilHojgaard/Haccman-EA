Overview:
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that causes inflammation and fluid in the air spaces. It often starts suddenly with fever and cough.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Common germs include bacteria and viruses. Older age, smoking, chronic illnesses, and weak immunity raise risk.

Common Symptoms:
Cough with phlegm, fever or chills, chest pain with deep breaths, and breathlessness. Tiredness and poor appetite are common.

Diagnosis:
Doctors listen to the chest, check oxygen levels, and may order a chest X-ray and blood tests. A sputum sample may help choose antibiotics.

Treatment:
Antibiotics are used for bacterial pneumonia; rest, fluids, and fever control support recovery. Oxygen may be needed if levels are low.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Drink fluids, take medicines as prescribed, and gradually return to activity. Avoid smoking and consider recommended vaccines.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help for worsening breathlessness, high fever, confusion, or chest pain. Go to emergency care if your lips turn blue or you struggle to breathe.

Prognosis:
Most people recover in a few weeks, though fatigue can last longer. Older adults or those with other illnesses may take more time.
