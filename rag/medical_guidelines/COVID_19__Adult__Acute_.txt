Document Information:
Disease - COVID-19 (Adult, Acute)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ID Unit

Purpose:
Offer a pragmatic framework for triage, oxygen support, and risk-based antiviral or anti-inflammatory therapy in acute COVID-19.

Scope:
For outpatient triage and hospital management of adults with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Indications:
Fever, cough, sore throat, anosmia, dyspnea, or hypoxemia following exposure or community spread.

Diagnosis:
Confirm with nucleic acid amplification or validated antigen testing; assess severity with oxygenation measures and imaging when indicated. Evaluate risk factors for progression.

Treatment/Management:
Provide oxygen to targets and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; consider antivirals or corticosteroids per risk and oxygen needs. Manage coinfections and escalate respiratory support as needed.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track respiratory trajectory, inflammatory markers when useful, and secondary infections. Plan safe isolation discontinuation and follow-up for persistent symptoms.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rising oxygen requirements, shock, or impending respiratory failure. Coordinate ICU transfer for high-flow or ventilatory support.

Safety Notes:
Review drug interactions with antivirals and immunomodulators. Apply infection prevention and appropriate PPE throughout care.
