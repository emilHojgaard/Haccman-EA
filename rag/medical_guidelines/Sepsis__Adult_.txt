Disease - Sepsis (Adult)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Acute Medicine/ICU

Purpose:
Standardize early identification, source control, antimicrobial therapy, and hemodynamic resuscitation for adult sepsis.

Scope:
Applies to adults with suspected infection and organ dysfunction across emergency and inpatient settings.

Indications:
Fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, altered mentation, or oliguria in the context of infection symptoms.

Diagnosis:
Assess for organ dysfunction with labs and lactate; obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible without delaying therapy. Identify likely source via examination and imaging as indicated.

Treatment/Management:
Administer timely broad-spectrum antibiotics and begin fluid resuscitation with reassessment; add vasopressors for persistent hypotension. Pursue source control procedures and tailor therapy with culture results.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track hemodynamics, urine output, lactate clearance, and end-organ function; de-escalate antimicrobials when stabilized. Reevaluate source and complications daily.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory shock, escalating oxygen requirements, or multiorgan failure. Involve ICU teams for advanced monitoring and support.

Safety Notes:
Avoid delays in antibiotics and ensure appropriate dosing in renal or hepatic dysfunction. Monitor for drug reactions and Clostridioides difficile risk.
