Task - Blood Glucose Monitoring (POC)
Date - 2025-04-22
Responsible Department - Endocrinology / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Obtain accurate capillary blood glucose measurements to guide therapy and detect hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia.

Scope:
For adult inpatients requiring glucose checks per protocol (e.g., insulin therapy, steroids, sepsis).

Indications:
Diabetes management, altered mental status evaluation, or therapy known to affect glucose.

Contraindications:
Avoid sampling from affected/edematous fingers or near infusion lines causing dilution. Consider lab confirmation if perfusion is poor.

Equipment:
POC glucose meter, quality-controlled strips, lancets, alcohol wipes, gauze, gloves, sharps container.

Procedure Steps:
Perform hand hygiene, confirm patient ID, and prepare the meter. Clean site, obtain capillary sample with minimal squeezing, apply to strip, record value, and dispose sharps safely.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Trend values and correlate with meals/insulin dosing; verify critical results. Document readings with time and related interventions.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain purpose and timing of checks and symptoms of hypo/hyperglycemia. Encourage reporting of hunger, tremor, or confusion promptly.

Escalation:
Escalate for severe hypoglycemia, persistent hyperglycemia, or unexplained variability. Notify prescriber for regimen adjustment.

Safety Notes:
Use control solutions and check expiry dates. Rotate finger sites and avoid excessive squeezing to improve accuracy.
