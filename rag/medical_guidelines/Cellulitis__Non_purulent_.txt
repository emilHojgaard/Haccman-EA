Purpose:
Standardize diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy for non-purulent cellulitis while identifying alternate etiologies.

Scope:
For adults presenting with acute limb erythema, warmth, and tenderness without abscess.

Indications:
Diffuse erythema with indistinct margins, edema, and tenderness often following minor skin breaks or tinea pedis.

Diagnosis:
Clinical diagnosis is primary; evaluate for mimics such as stasis dermatitis, gout, or DVT when features are atypical. Use ultrasound to exclude occult abscess if fluctuance is suspected.

Treatment/Management:
Start empiric antibiotics covering streptococci and tailor to risk factors; elevate the limb and treat portals of entry. Reserve broad MRSA coverage for systemic toxicity or prior MRSA.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Outline borders to track response and reassess within 48â€“72 hours; switch to oral therapy when stable. Address edema control and skin care to reduce recurrence.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapidly progressive infection, necrosis, or systemic instability. Consider surgical consultation if compartment syndrome or necrotizing infection is suspected.

Safety Notes:
Review allergy history and potential drug interactions; adjust dosing in renal impairment. Educate on wound hygiene and footwear in high-risk patients.
