TITLE: Coronary Artery Disease (Stable Angina) – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Cardiology Unit

Overview:
CAD involves atherosclerotic narrowing of coronary arteries causing exertional chest pressure relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Nursing priorities: symptom assessment, antianginal adherence, risk-modification coaching, escalation for unstable features.

Nursing Assessment:
- Characterize pain (location, quality, triggers, relief), exertional threshold.
- Review meds (beta-blocker, nitrates, CCB, antiplatelet, statin) and adherence.
- Vitals; risk factors (DM, HTN, lipids, smoking).

Key Monitoring:
- Frequency of angina episodes, nitrate use, and response.
- BP/HR trends, lipid/glucose targets per plan.

Nursing Interventions:
- Ensure availability/education on sublingual nitroglycerin (usage, max doses, when to call).
- Administer meds per MAR; reinforce daily statin/antiplatelet adherence.
- Activity pacing; cardiac rehab referral if indicated.

Patient Education:
- Chest pain action plan; risk-factor modification (smoking cessation, diet, exercise).

When to Escalate:
- Rest pain, increasing frequency/severity, prolonged pain >10 min, associated dyspnea/syncope → urgent eval.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Pain characteristics, medication use/responses, counseling provided; coordinate with cardiology.

Prognosis:
Good when risk factors controlled and therapy adhered to; recognize transition to unstable angina early.
