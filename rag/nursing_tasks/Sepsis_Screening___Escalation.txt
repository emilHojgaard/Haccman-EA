TITLE: Sepsis Screening & Escalation – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-09-30
Responsible Department: Acute Medicine / ICU Liaison

Purpose:
Identify suspected sepsis early and trigger timely escalation and bundle care.

Scope:
All adult inpatients and ED presentations.

Indications:
- Suspected infection with physiological derangement (fever/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, altered mentation)

Contraindications:
- None; screening tools guide rather than replace clinical judgment

Equipment:
- EWS chart, lactate sampling, blood culture kits, IV access supplies

Procedure Steps:
- Apply sepsis screening tool; obtain lactate, cultures (before antibiotics if possible); start fluids and antibiotics per protocol after urgent medical review.
- Begin oxygen if hypoxic; monitor closely.

Monitoring & Documentation:
- Record vitals frequently; track lactate trend; document time to antibiotics/fluids.

Patient Education:
- Explain concern, rapid investigations/treatments.

Escalation:
- Persistent hypotension, rising lactate, deteriorating EWS → rapid response/ICU.

Safety Notes:
- Early antibiotics save lives; de-escalate with culture results.
