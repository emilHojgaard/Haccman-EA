        This bot is designed to act like a digital medical assistant. It can
        answer questions, explain conditions, and suggest possible next steps
        based on documents it has access to.
        <br />
        Behind the scenes it uses something called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
        Generation). That means:
        <ul>
          <li>First it retrieves information from its library of documents.</li>
          <li>
            Then it uses that information to generate an answer in plain
            language.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The library it searches includes both classified patient journals
        (sensitive, personal records) and non-classified documents (general
        medical references, guidelines, and public information).
        <br />
        For you as a player: you don’t need to know the technical details—just
        that the bot tries to give answers by combining what it finds in its
        records with its ability to explain things clearly. Sometimes it may
        reveal information it shouldn’t, and sometimes it may rely only on
        public knowledge.
