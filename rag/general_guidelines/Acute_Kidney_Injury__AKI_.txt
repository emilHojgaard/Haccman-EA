Responsible Department - Nephrology

Overview:
AKI is a sudden drop in kidney function that can happen over hours to days. It may occur during illness, dehydration, or after certain medicines.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Sepsis, vomiting/diarrhea, heart failure, contrast dye, and NSAIDs can trigger AKI. Older age and CKD increase risk.

Common Symptoms:
Reduced urine, swelling, fatigue, or confusion; sometimes there are no symptoms, only abnormal blood tests.

Diagnosis:
Blood and urine tests confirm the problem, and scans may check for blockage. Doctors review medicines closely.

Treatment:
Fluids, stopping harmful medicines, and treating the underlying cause usually help. Some people need temporary dialysis.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Stay hydrated during illness, avoid NSAIDs unless advised, and follow medical plans for chronic conditions.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek care for persistent vomiting, severe dehydration, or sudden swelling/shortness of breath.

Prognosis:
Many recover fully, though some have lasting changes. Future episodes can be prevented with early action.
