TITLE: Ulcerative Colitis

Overview:
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon lining, starting in the rectum and spreading proximally in a continuous pattern.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Immune dysregulation; family history
- Former smoking status sometimes protective (not recommended as therapy)

Common Symptoms:
- Bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, crampy pain
- Fatigue, weight loss in severe disease

Diagnosis:
- Colonoscopy with biopsies; elevated fecal calprotectin
- Labs for anemia/inflammation; screen for infections

Treatment:
- 5-ASA agents for mild-moderate disease, steroids for flares
- Immunomodulators/biologics for steroid-dependent or severe disease
- Cancer surveillance colonoscopies after long disease duration

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Adherence to maintenance therapy
- Nutrition support during flares; vaccinations

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Severe bleeding, high fever, severe abdominal pain/distension

Prognosis:
Many maintain remission on modern therapy; colorectal cancer risk rises with extensive longstanding colitisâ€”regular surveillance is key.
