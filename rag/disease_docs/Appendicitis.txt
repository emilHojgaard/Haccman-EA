Overview:
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix that often requires surgery. It typically starts with belly pain that moves to the lower right side.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Blockage of the appendix by stool or swelling can trigger inflammation. It can occur at any age.

Common Symptoms:
Pain that shifts to the right lower abdomen, loss of appetite, nausea, and fever. Coughing or movement can worsen pain.

Diagnosis:
Doctors examine the abdomen and may use blood tests and imaging such as ultrasound or CT scans.

Treatment:
Most people have surgery to remove the appendix; antibiotics are given before and sometimes after. Selected mild cases may be treated with antibiotics alone.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Follow post-op instructions on activity and wound care. Gradually return to normal diet as advised.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent care for sudden worsening pain, high fever, vomiting, or swelling after surgery.

Prognosis:
Recovery is usually quick after surgery. Complications are uncommon when treated early.
