TITLE: Urinary Tract Infection (Uncomplicated)

Overview:
UTI is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract (bladder). It commonly affects women and usually responds promptly to oral antibiotics.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Short urethra in women, sexual activity, spermicide use
- Post-menopausal changes; poor hydration

Common Symptoms:
- Dysuria, frequency, urgency; suprapubic discomfort
- Usually afebrile (fever suggests upper UTI)

Diagnosis:
- Urinalysis (nitrites/leukocyte esterase), urine culture if atypical or recurrent
- Consider STIs or pelvic causes if symptoms atypical

Treatment:
- Short course oral antibiotics per local resistance patterns
- Analgesia (e.g., phenazopyridine where used), hydration

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Increase fluid intake; regular voiding; post-coital voiding
- Consider vaginal estrogen in post-menopausal recurrent UTI (per clinician)

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Fever/flank pain (possible pyelonephritis), pregnancy, or lack of improvement in 48â€“72 hours

Prognosis:
Excellent with appropriate therapy; recurrent UTIs may need preventive strategies.
