Purpose:
Provide a structured approach to evaluating volume status, precipitating factors, and stabilizing adults with acute decompensated heart failure.

Scope:
For emergency and inpatient teams managing adults with known or suspected heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Indications:
Worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, rapid weight gain, or fatigue often triggered by dietary indiscretion, arrhythmia, ischemia, or infection.

Diagnosis:
Assess vitals, natriuretic peptides, renal function, and chest imaging; evaluate perfusion and congestion at the bedside. Use echocardiography to characterize ejection fraction and structural disease.

Treatment/Management:
Administer loop diuretics with careful titration and consider vasodilators for hypertensive congestion. Optimize guideline-directed medical therapy once stable and treat precipitants such as ischemia or arrhythmia.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track urine output, electrolytes, renal function, and weight; adjust diuretics to achieve euvolemia. Arrange education on diet, fluid limits, and early outpatient follow-up.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypotension with hypoperfusion, refractory hypoxemia, or shock requiring inotropes or mechanical support. Involve cardiology for advanced therapies or unclear hemodynamics.

Safety Notes:
Avoid excessive diuresis causing prerenal azotemia or electrolyte derangements. Review ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRA, SGLT2i tolerability and contraindications before up-titration.
