Disease - Prostate Cancer (Overview of Initial Management)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Urology/Oncology Unit

Purpose:
Summarize risk-stratified evaluation and first-line management options for localized and advanced prostate cancer.

Scope:
For outpatient and multidisciplinary teams counseling adults with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.

Indications:
Elevated PSA, abnormal digital rectal exam, or imaging findings prompting biopsy; symptoms may include obstructive urinary complaints or bone pain in advanced disease.

Diagnosis:
Confirm with pathology and assign grade group; stage with imaging based on risk. Discuss genomic testing and baseline function to inform treatment decisions.

Treatment/Management:
Offer active surveillance for low-risk disease and consider surgery or radiation for higher risk categories. Use androgen-deprivation therapy and systemic options for advanced disease in coordination with oncology.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track PSA trends, treatment side effects, and functional outcomes including continence and sexual function. Coordinate survivorship care and bone health strategies.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapidly rising PSA, symptomatic progression, or complications such as spinal cord compression. Involve radiation or medical oncology for advanced therapies.

Safety Notes:
Counsel on fertility, metabolic effects of androgen deprivation, and fracture risk. Screen for cardiovascular risk factors during systemic therapy.
