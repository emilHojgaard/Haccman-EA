Responsible Department: Nutrition Support / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Provide safe placement verification and delivery of short-term enteral nutrition and medications via NG tube.

Scope:
Nurses trained in NG tube management in ward and community settings.

Indications:

Contraindications:
- Suspected basal skull fracture, severe facial trauma
- High aspiration risk without appropriate precautions and orders

Equipment:
- Fine-bore NG tube, lubricant, tape/fixation device
- pH indicator strips, feeding pump/sets, prescribed feed, PPE

Procedure Steps:
- Hand hygiene; explain; seat patient upright ≥30–45°.
- Measure NEX; lubricate and insert via nostril to mark.
- Verify placement per policy (aspirate pH ≤5.5; radiograph if required). Never use auscultation alone.
- Secure tube; commence feed at prescribed rate; flush before/after medications.

Monitoring & Documentation:
- Confirm position before each use; check patency; monitor tolerance (pain, nausea, residuals per policy).
- Record intake, weight, hydration, bowel pattern; document any complications.

Patient Education:
- Purpose of tube, posture during/after feeding, signs of distress to report.
- Community care: cleaning, flushing, and troubleshooting.

Escalation:
- Respiratory distress, suspected displacement, repeated high residuals, vomiting/aspiration.

Safety Notes:
- Maintain head elevation during and after feeding as per policy.
- Use liquid formulations when possible; flush routinely to prevent blockage.
