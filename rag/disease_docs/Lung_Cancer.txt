TITLE: Lung Cancer

Overview:
Lung cancer includes non-small cell (most common) and small cell types. Smoking is the main risk factor, though non-smokers can be affected.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Smoking, secondhand smoke, radon
- Occupational exposures (asbestos), air pollution

Common Symptoms:
- Persistent cough, hemoptysis, chest pain
- Weight loss, breathlessness, recurrent infections

Diagnosis:
- Imaging (CXR/CT), PET-CT for staging
- Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy; molecular profiling for targeted therapy

Treatment:
- Surgery for early-stage disease; radiotherapy as indicated
- Systemic therapies: platinum chemo, targeted agents (EGFR/ALK/ROS1, etc.), immunotherapy
- Palliative care integrated early for symptoms

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Smoking cessation improves outcomes at any stage
- Nutrition and exercise as tolerated; symptom control (cough, pain)

When to Seek Medical Help:
- New or worsening cough, coughing blood, unexplained weight loss

Prognosis:
Depends on stage and biology; targeted and immune therapies have improved survival for many.
