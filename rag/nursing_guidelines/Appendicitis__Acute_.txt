Overview:
Appendicitis is acute inflammation of the appendix requiring timely diagnosis and usually surgery. Nursing care supports pain control, NPO status, and perioperative safety.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess pain migration to the right lower quadrant, fever, nausea, and guarding. Review pregnancy status and last oral intake.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor vitals, pain scores, and signs of perforation such as worsening tenderness or sepsis. Track fluids and antibiotics timing.

Nursing Interventions:
Maintain NPO, establish IV access, and administer fluids and antibiotics per orders. Provide analgesia and assist with surgical preparation.

Patient Education:
Explain the surgical plan and recovery expectations. Reinforce early mobilization and wound care after surgery.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for signs of peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or uncontrolled pain. Notify the team for suspected abscess or deterioration.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document exam changes, analgesia response, and antibiotic timing. Coordinate handover to operating room and postoperative unit.

Prognosis:
Outcomes are excellent with early intervention. Nursing NPO adherence and antibiotic timing reduce complications.
