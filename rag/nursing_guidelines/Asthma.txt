Overview:
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder with variable airflow limitation and hyperresponsiveness. Nursing priorities are to support bronchodilation, oxygenation, and education on trigger control and inhaler technique.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess severity: speech in sentences, accessory muscle use, posture, agitation, and fatigue. Review triggers, controller adherence, prior ICU/intubations, and recent infections; check PEFR if available.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor SpO₂ and work of breathing frequently, observing for silent chest or rising fatigue. Track response to each bronchodilator dose and record PEFR trends when used.

Nursing Interventions:
Position upright, provide calm reassurance, and administer prescribed bronchodilators via spacer/nebulizer. Titrate oxygen to ordered targets and prepare/assist with systemic corticosteroids per orders.

Patient Education:
Teach correct inhaler and spacer technique and review the written action plan. Counsel on trigger reduction including smoke exposure, dust mites, viral hygiene, and pre-exercise reliever use if prescribed.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for SpO₂ below ordered targets, silent chest, exhaustion, or failure to respond to initial therapy. Alert the team immediately if patient cannot speak in full sentences or shows cyanosis.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document pre/post SpO₂, RR, PEFR, medications given, and clinical response. Handover trigger profile, action plan status, and follow-up needs to the next shift or community team.

Prognosis:
Prognosis is good with consistent controller use and technique; nursing vigilance reduces exacerbation severity. Early education and action plans lower emergency presentations.
