Overview:
Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually due to a gallstone blocking the duct. It causes right-sided upper abdominal pain and fever.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Gallstones are the main cause. Older age, obesity, and female sex raise the chance of stones.

Common Symptoms:
Persistent right upper abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Pain may worsen after fatty meals.

Diagnosis:
An ultrasound scan typically confirms the diagnosis. Blood tests look for inflammation and bile duct blockage.

Treatment:
Pain relief, antibiotics, and early surgery to remove the gallbladder are common. High-risk patients may need a drain temporarily.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
After recovery, choose a balanced diet and limit very fatty foods initially. Stay active to support digestion.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent help for increasing pain, jaundice, or fever. After surgery, report redness, swelling, or persistent vomiting.

Prognosis:
Most people recover fully after gallbladder removal. Recurrence is unlikely once the gallbladder is gone.
