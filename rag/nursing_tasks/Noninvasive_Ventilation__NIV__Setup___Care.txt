Task - Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV) Setup & Care
Date - 2023-03-15
Responsible Department - Respiratory / ICU

Purpose:
Provide positive pressure support for acute respiratory failure while avoiding intubation when appropriate.

Scope:
For trained nurses in monitored settings initiating or maintaining NIV (CPAP/BiPAP) per protocol.

Indications:
Hypercapnic COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or selected hypoxemic failure with intact airway and cooperation.

Contraindications:
Impaired consciousness, copious secretions, facial trauma, or hemodynamic instability. Relative caution with agitation or poor mask tolerance.

Equipment:
NIV device, mask interfaces, headgear, heated humidification if available, oxygen supply, monitoring equipment.

Procedure Steps:
Explain therapy, select mask size, apply with minimal leaks, set initial pressures per protocol, and titrate based on comfort and gas exchange. Provide skin protection at pressure points.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Monitor respiratory rate, SpO₂, CO₂ markers/ABGs, comfort, and mask leaks. Document settings, tolerance, and skin checks.

Patient/Family Education:
Describe goals, sensations of pressure, and the importance of mask cooperation. Reassure regarding breaks for hydration and communication.

Escalation:
Escalate for worsening oxygenation/ventilation, declining mental status, or hemodynamic instability. Prepare for intubation if failure criteria met.

Safety Notes:
Avoid prolonged pressure on nasal bridge and ensure rapid access to airway equipment. Keep suction available for secretions.
