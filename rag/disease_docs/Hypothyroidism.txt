TITLE: Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid)

Overview:
Hypothyroidism is reduced thyroid hormone production, slowing body processes and causing fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimotoâ€™s), thyroid surgery or radioiodine
- Certain drugs (amiodarone, lithium); iodine imbalance

Common Symptoms:
- Tiredness, depression, constipation, dry skin, hair thinning
- Menstrual changes, weight gain, cold sensitivity

Diagnosis:
- Elevated TSH with low free T4
- Screen for autoimmune thyroiditis (TPO antibodies) if needed

Treatment:
- Levothyroxine replacement; dose individualized by weight/age, pregnancy
- Take on empty stomach; separate from iron/calcium

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Adherence to dosing and timing
- Report symptoms of over- or under-replacement

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Severe lethargy, confusion, hypothermia (rare myxedema crisis)

Prognosis:
Excellent with correct dosing; periodic TSH checks guide therapy.
