TITLE: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0

Responsible Department: Endocrinology Unit

Overview:
Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Nursing focus: glucose monitoring, medication administration, hypoglycemia prevention, foot/skin checks, and education.

Nursing Assessment:
- History: meds (metformin, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, insulin), adherence, diet/activity patterns.
- Check: blood glucose trends, foot integrity, hydration, comorbidities (HTN, CKD).
- Vitals & labs: BP, weight/BMI, recent HbA1c, eGFR if relevant to dosing.

Key Monitoring:
- Capillary glucose per prescription (AC/HS or more often if unstable).
- Watch for hypo (sweats, tremor, confusion) and hyper (polydipsia, polyuria, fatigue).
- Injection sites/pen technique; renal function considerations for dosing.

Nursing Interventions:
- Administer oral agents/insulin per MAR; verify timing with meals.
- Treat hypoglycemia promptly: 15–20 g rapid-acting carb; recheck in 15 min; escalate if LOC impaired.
- Reinforce sick-day rules: hydration, maintain carbs/insulin as prescribed, when to seek help.

Patient Education:
- Glucose targets, SMBG technique, injection technique, sharps safety.
- Diet (portion control, fiber), activity (≥150 min/week), foot checks; annual eye/renal review.

When to Escalate:
- Recurrent hypo/hyperglycemia despite adherence; vomiting/ketones; altered mental status.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Record glucose values, insulin units, events (hypo), teaching given, and referrals to diabetes nurse/educator.

Prognosis:
Excellent with sustained lifestyle and medication adherence; nursing follow-up reduces complications.
