- Triggers: infections, skin trauma, certain drugs, stress

Common Symptoms:

- Nail pitting, onycholysis; possible joint pain (psoriatic arthritis)

Diagnosis:
- Clinical; biopsy if atypical
- Screen for psoriatic arthritis (joint swelling, dactylitis)

Treatment:
- Topical steroids/vitamin D analogs for mild disease
- Phototherapy or systemic agents (methotrexate, biologics) for moderateâ€“severe
- Moisturizers and trigger management

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Emollients, gentle skincare; avoid scratching/trauma
- Weight control, reduced alcohol, smoking cessation

When to Seek Medical Help:

Prognosis:
Chronic with flares/remission; modern therapies achieve excellent skin clearance in many.
