Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the GI tract, commonly the terminal ileum and colon, with skip lesions and transmural inflammation.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Immune dysregulation in genetically susceptible individuals
- Smoking increases risk and severity

Common Symptoms:
- Abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss

Diagnosis:
- Colonoscopy with biopsies; MR/CT enterography
- Fecal calprotectin; blood tests for inflammation/anemia

Treatment:
- Induction with steroids for flares; maintenance with immunomodulators/biologics
- Nutrition optimization; treat complications (strictures, fistulae)
- Smoking cessation is essential

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Medication adherence, vaccination updates
- Balanced nutrition; manage stress and fatigue

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Severe pain, persistent fever, bleeding, obstruction symptoms

Prognosis:
Relapsing-remitting course; modern biologics improve remission rates and reduce complications.
