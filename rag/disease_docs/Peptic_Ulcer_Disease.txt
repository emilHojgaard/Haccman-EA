Overview:
Peptic ulcers are sores in the stomach or duodenum that can cause burning pain. They may bleed if untreated.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Infection with H. pylori and regular NSAID/aspirin use are common causes. Smoking and heavy alcohol increase risk.

Common Symptoms:
Burning upper abdominal pain often related to meals, bloating, and nausea. Some people develop anemia or black stools.

Diagnosis:
Endoscopy confirms the ulcer and can treat bleeding. Non-invasive tests detect H. pylori infection.

Treatment:
Stomach acid medicines help healing; eradication therapy cures H. pylori. Stopping NSAIDs reduces recurrence.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Avoid smoking and excess alcohol and take medicines exactly as prescribed. Eat smaller, more frequent meals if it helps.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent help for vomiting blood, black stools, or severe persistent pain.

Prognosis:
Healing rates are high with modern therapy. Recurrence is uncommon once the cause is addressed.
