Overview:
High blood pressure is when the force of blood against artery walls stays too high over time. It often causes no symptoms but damages organs silently.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Age, family history, obesity, high salt intake, alcohol, inactivity, and sleep apnea raise risk. Some medicines can increase pressure.

Common Symptoms:
Usually none. Severe or sudden spikes may cause headache, nosebleeds, or dizziness.

Diagnosis:
Multiple readings on different days or ambulatory monitoring confirm the diagnosis. Doctors also assess overall heart and kidney risk.

Treatment:
Lifestyle changes plus medicines when needed help reach targets. Many people require more than one medicine.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Check pressure at home, reduce salt, stay active, manage weight, and limit alcohol. Take medicines at the same time daily.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek care for severe headache, chest pain, breathlessness, or vision changes. Contact your doctor if readings remain high despite treatment.

Prognosis:
Good control prevents strokes, heart attacks, and kidney disease. Most people reach goals with a consistent plan.
