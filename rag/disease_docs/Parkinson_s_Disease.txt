TITLE: Parkinson’s Disease

Overview:
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability due to dopamine loss in the basal ganglia.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Ageing, genetics (in a minority), environmental exposures
- Male sex slightly higher risk

Common Symptoms:
- Slowness of movement, stiffness, resting tremor
- Small handwriting, reduced facial expression, soft voice
- Non-motor: constipation, sleep disturbance, mood changes

Diagnosis:
- Clinical diagnosis; response to dopaminergic therapy supports
- MRI usually normal, used to exclude mimics

Treatment:
- Levodopa is most effective; dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors
- Physiotherapy, occupational/speech therapy; exercise programs
- Deep brain stimulation for selected patients

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Regular exercise, balance training; home safety modifications
- Medication timing consistency; nutrition strategies

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Sudden worsening mobility, recurrent falls, medication side-effects (dyskinesias)

Prognosis:
Progressive, but therapy significantly improves symptoms and quality of life.
