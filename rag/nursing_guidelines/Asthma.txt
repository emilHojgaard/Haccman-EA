TITLE: Asthma – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0

Responsible Department: Pulmonology Unit

Overview:
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder with variable airflow limitation and hyperresponsiveness. Nursing priorities: assess severity, deliver prescribed bronchodilation and oxygen, evaluate response, teach trigger control and inhaler technique.

Nursing Assessment:
- History: triggers, controller adherence, prior ICU/intubations, recent infections.
- Inspection: accessory muscle use, ability to speak, agitation/fatigue.
- Vitals & O2: RR, HR, BP, SpO₂ (target ≥ 94% unless otherwise prescribed).
- Auscultation: wheeze, reduced air entry, “silent chest” (ominous).
- Peak flow (if trained/device available) vs personal best.

Key Monitoring:
- SpO₂ and respiratory effort q15–30 min in acute care, then hourly when stable.
- Frequency of SABA use; response after each dose.
- Signs of exhaustion, CO₂ retention (drowsiness), or worsening work of breathing.

Nursing Interventions:
- Position upright; calm environment; bronchodilator via spacer/nebulizer as prescribed.
- Administer oxygen to target saturation; prepare/assist with systemic steroids if ordered.
- Check and correct inhaler/spacer technique; ensure spacer availability.
- Prepare for escalation (magnesium neb/IV per local protocol) when ordered.

Patient Education:
- Written asthma action plan; daily preventer adherence; correct inhaler technique.
- Trigger avoidance: smoke, pets, dust mites, viral hygiene; pre-exercise SABA if prescribed.

When to Escalate:
- SpO₂ < 92% on oxygen, silent chest, inability to speak full sentences, exhaustion, cyanosis.
- No clinical response after initial SABA cycles or deteriorating PEFR.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Record pre/post values (SpO₂, RR, PEFR), meds given, responses, education provided.
- Handover triggers, action plan status, and follow-up needs to next shift/community team.

Prognosis:
Good with consistent controller therapy, technique, and trigger management; nursing vigilance reduces severe exacerbations.
