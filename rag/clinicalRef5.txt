Atrial Fibrillation

History: 
Known history of atrial fibrillation. No chest pain, dizziness, or syncope. 
Reports occasional palpitations.

Examination: 
Irregularly irregular pulse at 78 bpm. Blood pressure stable. No evidence of heart failure.

Investigations: 
INR within therapeutic range. Echocardiogram previously showed preserved ejection fraction.

Assessment: 
Stable atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation with good rate control.

Plan: 
Continue current anticoagulation. Monitor INR regularly. 
Continue rate-control medication. Educate patient on stroke symptoms and when to seek urgent care.

Heart Failure â€“ Clinical Reference Summary

Definition:
Syndrome of impaired cardiac function leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and fluid retention.

Epidemiology:
Common in older adults; high rates of hospitalization. Risk factors: hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, valvular disease.

Pathophysiology:
Systolic or diastolic dysfunction triggers neurohormonal activation, including RAAS and sympathetic nervous system, causing fluid retention and remodeling.

Clinical Features:
Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, jugular venous distension.

Investigations:

Echocardiography for ejection fraction and structural assessment.

BNP/NT-proBNP to assess severity.

ECG, chest X-ray, renal function tests.

Treatment / Management:

Pharmacologic: ACE inhibitors/ARBs (enalapril, losartan), beta-blockers (carvedilol, bisoprolol), diuretics (furosemide) for symptoms, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone), SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin) per guidelines.

Non-Pharmacologic: Fluid and salt restriction, weight monitoring, structured exercise.

Procedural: Device therapy (ICD, CRT) for selected patients.

Key Points:
Guideline-directed therapy improves survival and reduces hospitalization. Patient education is critical.
