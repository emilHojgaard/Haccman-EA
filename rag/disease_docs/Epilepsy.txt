Overview:
Epilepsy is a condition where someone has a tendency to have recurrent seizures. Many people live full lives with the right treatment plan.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Causes include prior brain injury, stroke, genetic factors, infections, or may be unknown. Missed medicines and sleep loss can trigger seizures.

Common Symptoms:
Seizures can involve shaking, staring spells, confusion, or brief loss of awareness. Recovery time varies.

Diagnosis:
Doctors review events, perform an EEG, and may order brain imaging. Blood tests help look for contributing problems.

Treatment:
Most seizures are controlled with daily medicines. Some people benefit from devices or surgery if medicines are not enough.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Take medicines on schedule, get consistent sleep, and avoid known triggers like heavy alcohol. Have a safety plan with family or friends.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Call emergency services for seizures lasting more than 5 minutes, repeated seizures without full recovery, or injury during a seizure.

Prognosis:
Many people become seizure-free with treatment. Regular follow-up improves safety and quality of life.
