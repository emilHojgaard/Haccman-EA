Subjective:
Sanne H. presents with 5 days of productive cough, pleuritic right-sided chest pain, and fevers with chills. Shortness of breath noted on climbing stairs; no hemoptysis. Recent viral contact at home.

Objective:
Temp 38.9°C, RR 23/min, SpO2 93% RA. Auscultation: focal crackles and bronchial breath sounds over RLL. No peripheral cyanosis; cardiovascular exam normal.
Labs (today): CXR: right lower lobe consolidation. WBC 11×10⁹/L with left shift; CRP elevated. Renal function normal.

Assessment:
Community-acquired pneumonia, likely typical bacterial etiology. CURB-65 low risk; outpatient therapy appropriate.

Plan:
- Start oral amoxicillin or doxycycline (if penicillin allergy). Emphasize hydration, antipyretics, and return precautions for worsening dyspnea. Re-assess in 48–72 hours; follow-up chest X-ray in 6–8 weeks if persistent symptoms.
- Follow-up in 4 weeks as appropriate.
