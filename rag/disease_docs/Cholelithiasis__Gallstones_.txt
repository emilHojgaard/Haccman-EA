TITLE: Cholelithiasis (Gallstones)

Overview:
Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder. Many are asymptomatic; symptomatic stones cause biliary colicâ€”episodes of right upper abdominal pain after fatty meals.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Female sex, age, obesity, rapid weight loss, pregnancy
- Hemolytic conditions (pigment stones)

Common Symptoms:
- Episodic right upper quadrant pain radiating to back/right shoulder
- Nausea/vomiting; pain lasts minutes to hours, resolves between attacks

Diagnosis:
- Abdominal ultrasound (stones, gallbladder wall, bile ducts)
- LFTs; assess for complications (cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis)

Treatment:
- Analgesia during attacks; elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for recurrent symptoms
- ERCP if ductal stones; antibiotics for cholecystitis

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Reduce dietary fat to minimize attacks
- Weight management and steady weight loss if needed

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Persistent pain with fever, jaundice, or severe tenderness (possible complications)

Prognosis:
Excellent after cholecystectomy; asymptomatic stones generally observed.
