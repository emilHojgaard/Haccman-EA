Disease - Ischemic Stroke (Acute)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Neurology/Stroke Unit

Purpose:
Guide rapid recognition, neuroimaging, and reperfusion eligibility assessment for acute ischemic stroke.

Scope:
For prehospital, emergency, and stroke-unit teams evaluating adults with new focal neurological deficits.

Indications:
Sudden onset facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, visual field loss, or gait imbalance within a definable time window.

Diagnosis:
Perform immediate neurological assessment and non-contrast head CT to exclude hemorrhage; consider CT/MR angiography for large vessel occlusion. Determine last known well and contraindications to reperfusion.

Treatment/Management:
Manage airway and blood pressure targets and evaluate eligibility for thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy per local criteria. Provide antiplatelet therapy and DVT prophylaxis when reperfusion is not pursued.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for neurological worsening, hemorrhagic conversion, dysphagia, and aspiration; start early rehabilitation. Address secondary prevention including blood pressure, lipids, and atrial fibrillation screening.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for decreasing level of consciousness, refractory hypertension, or malignant cerebral edema. Involve neurosurgery and critical care if deterioration or large infarct syndromes develop.

Safety Notes:
Confirm glucose and exclude mimics such as seizures; avoid hypotension and hyperthermia. Carefully apply reperfusion inclusion and exclusion criteria.
