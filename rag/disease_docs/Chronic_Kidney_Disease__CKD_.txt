Overview:
CKD is a gradual loss of kidney function over months to years. Early identification and treatment slow progression.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Diabetes, high blood pressure, and vascular disease are common causes. Family history and certain medicines can contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Often none at first; later, swelling, tiredness, or changes in urination may appear.

Diagnosis:
Blood and urine tests measure kidney function and protein loss. Ultrasound may assess kidney size and structure.

Treatment:
Blood pressure and sugar control, medicines that protect the kidneys, and avoiding harmful drugs help preserve function.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Follow a kidney-friendly diet as advised, stop smoking, and keep active. Review all medicines with your care team.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Contact your doctor for rapid swelling, breathlessness, or very high blood pressure. Seek advice before using NSAIDs or contrast dyes.

Prognosis:
Many people live well for years with CKD when risks are controlled. Planning ahead helps if function declines.
