Overview:
Asthma is a long-term condition where the airways become inflamed and sensitive, making them narrow at times. Symptoms tend to come and go and can be triggered by infections, allergens, or exercise.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Family history of asthma or allergies, exposure to dust mites, pollen, pets, smoke, and air pollution increase risk. Viral infections and cold air can also trigger attacks.

Common Symptoms:
Wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, especially at night or early morning. Symptoms may worsen with exercise or colds.

Diagnosis:
Doctors ask about symptoms and triggers and perform breathing tests like spirometry to look for variable airflow. Allergy testing may be used to identify triggers.

Treatment:
Reliever inhalers quickly open the airways for symptoms, while preventer inhalers reduce inflammation over time. Some people need combination inhalers or add-on medicines if symptoms persist.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Use a written action plan, practice correct inhaler technique, and avoid triggers such as smoke. Warm up before exercise and keep vaccinations up to date.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help if you need your reliever more than a few times a week, or if breathing is difficult and you cannot speak full sentences. Call emergency services for blue lips, severe breathlessness, or no response to reliever.

Prognosis:
With regular preventer use and trigger control, most people live fully active lives with few attacks.
