Responsible Department: Neurology Unit

Overview:
Tendency for unprovoked seizures. Nursing priorities: safety during events, med adherence, trigger reduction, post-ictal care.

Nursing Assessment:
- Seizure type/frequency; triggers (sleep loss, alcohol, illness).
- Med adherence and side effects; injury risk.

Key Monitoring:
- Post-ictal recovery, airway/breathing; medication levels if ordered.

Nursing Interventions:
- During seizure: protect head, time event, do not restrain, place in recovery position after; call for help if >5 mins (status).
- Administer rescue meds as prescribed.

Patient Education:
- Adherence; sleep hygiene; driving/work safety rules; seizure first aid for family.

When to Escalate:
- Status epilepticus, repeated seizures without recovery, new neuro deficits.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Event details, triggers, meds given; liaison with neurology.

Prognosis:
Many gain seizure control; nursing education reduces harm.
