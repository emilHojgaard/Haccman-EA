Task - Urinary Catheterization (Indwelling, Aseptic Technique)
Date - 2023-12-11
Responsible Department - Urology / Medical Ward

Purpose:
Establish bladder drainage using aseptic technique while minimizing catheter-associated infection. Ensure correct sizing and securement.

Scope:
Applies to nurses trained and authorized to insert Foley catheters in adults. Use gender-appropriate equipment and chaperone per policy.

Indications:
Acute urinary retention, accurate output monitoring in critical illness, perioperative needs, or wound healing protection where necessary.

Contraindications:
Suspected urethral trauma (blood at meatus, high-riding prostate) or recent urethral surgery; consider urology input. Avoid for convenience alone.

Equipment:
Sterile catheter kit with appropriate catheter size, sterile field, antiseptic, anesthetic gel, drainage bag, securement device, PPE, and waste disposal.

Procedure Steps:
Explain procedure and obtain consent; perform hand hygiene and don PPE. Prepare sterile field, clean meatus, instill anesthetic gel, insert catheter until urine flows, inflate balloon per manufacturer guidance, connect drainage bag, and secure.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Record size/type, balloon volume, urine characteristics, and indication. Monitor output, patency, and signs of infection; maintain closed system and dependent drainage.

Patient/Family Education:
Teach catheter care, hygiene, and bag positioning below bladder. Explain signs of blockage or infection and when to seek help.

Escalation:
Escalate for failed insertion, severe pain, hematuria, or bypassing/leakage. Seek urgent review for suspected trauma or urosepsis.

Safety Notes:
Use sterile technique, correct balloon volume, and avoid traction on the catheter. Reassess daily for ongoing need to reduce catheter days.
