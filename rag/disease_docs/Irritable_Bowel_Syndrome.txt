TITLE: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Overview:
IBS is a functional bowel disorder causing abdominal pain related to defecation, with changes in stool frequency or form, without structural disease.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Gutâ€“brain axis dysregulation, visceral hypersensitivity
- Prior infections, antibiotics, stress; family history

Common Symptoms:
- Crampy abdominal pain, bloating, gas
- Diarrhea, constipation, or alternating patterns
- Symptom relief after bowel movement

Diagnosis:
- Rome IV criteria; normal basic tests (FBC, CRP) in typical cases
- Red flags (weight loss, bleeding, anemia) prompt further work-up

Treatment:
- Diet: low-FODMAP trial, fiber adjustment
- Symptom-targeted meds (antispasmodics, laxatives, antidiarrheals)
- Psychological therapies (CBT) and stress management

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Regular meals, hydration, gradual fiber changes
- Exercise and sleep routines; trigger diary

When to Seek Medical Help:
- New red flags, persistent nocturnal symptoms, weight loss

Prognosis:
Chronic, fluctuating course; many achieve good control with diet and tailored therapy.
