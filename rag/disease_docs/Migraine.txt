TITLE: Migraine Without Aura

Overview:
Migraine is a recurrent headache disorder causing moderate to severe throbbing pain, often one-sided, with sensitivity to light/sound and nausea.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Family history; hormonal fluctuations
- Triggers: stress, sleep changes, certain foods, dehydration

Common Symptoms:
- Throbbing headache lasting 4–72 hours
- Nausea/vomiting; photophobia/phonophobia
- Worsens with physical activity

Diagnosis:
- Clinical criteria based on typical features and recurring attacks
- Neurological exam normal between attacks; imaging only if red flags

Treatment:
- Acute: triptan + NSAID (if no contraindication), antiemetic
- Preventive: beta-blockers, topiramate, CGRP-targeted therapies if frequent/severe

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Headache diary; sleep hygiene; hydration; regular meals
- Trigger management; limit acute meds to avoid medication-overuse headache

When to Seek Medical Help:
- “Worst ever” sudden headache, new neuro symptoms, fever/stiff neck
- Increased frequency or refractory attacks

Prognosis:
Most achieve control with a mix of acute and preventive strategies.
