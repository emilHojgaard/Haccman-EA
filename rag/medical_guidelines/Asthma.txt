Responsible Department: Pulmonology Unit

1. Purpose
Provide guidance on diagnosis, severity assessment, pharmacologic management, and exacerbation care for adult asthma.

2. Scope
Applies to: Physicians in ED/outpatient/ward settings managing adults with suspected or confirmed asthma.

3. Indications
Evaluation and treatment of variable airflow limitation with typical symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough).

4. Diagnosis
- Clinical pattern with variable respiratory symptoms.
- Spirometry: ↓FEV1/FVC with bronchodilator reversibility (↑FEV1 ≥12% and ≥200 mL).
- Peak flow variability; consider bronchoprovocation if spirometry inconclusive.
- Differentiate from COPD, cardiac dyspnea, VCD; evaluate triggers and atopy.

5. Treatment/Management
- Controller: Low/med ICS; escalate to ICS/LABA; consider LAMA, LTRA, biologics for severe eosinophilic/Type 2.
- Reliever: As-needed SABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol (per local protocol).
- Exacerbation: Oxygen to target SpO₂ ≥94%; SABA/ipratropium; systemic steroids; magnesium sulfate IV in severe cases.
- Vaccines: Influenza, pneumococcal as indicated.

6. Monitoring & Follow-up
- Check inhaler technique, adherence, and trigger control every visit.
- Step-up/step-down per control; provide written action plan; consider FeNO/allergy workup.

7. When to Escalate
- Life-threatening features (silent chest, hypoxia, exhaustion); ICU involvement.
- Frequent exacerbations despite high-dose ICS/LABA → biologic referral.

8. Safety Notes
- Use minimal effective steroid dose; assess osteoporosis, glucose.
- Educate on anaphylaxis plan if biologics administered.
