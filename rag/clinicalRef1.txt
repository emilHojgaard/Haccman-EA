Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

Definition:
Chronic elevation of arterial blood pressure, typically ≥140/90 mmHg, with persistent elevation confirmed on repeated measurements. 
Can be primary (essential) or secondary to another underlying condition.

Epidemiology:
Very common worldwide, affecting adults of all ages. 
Prevalence increases with age, obesity, high salt intake, sedentary lifestyle, and family history. 
Leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease.

Pathophysiology:
Multifactorial mechanisms include increased peripheral vascular resistance, endothelial dysfunction, 
overactive sympathetic nervous system, renal sodium retention, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system dysregulation. 
Long-term hypertension causes vascular remodeling, left ventricular hypertrophy, and organ damage.

Clinical Features:
Often asymptomatic. Possible symptoms include headache, dizziness, palpitations, blurred vision, or tinnitus. 
Chronic uncontrolled hypertension may lead to heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, or retinopathy.

Investigations:
- Repeated blood pressure measurements (office, home, ambulatory).
- Basic labs: renal function, electrolytes, fasting lipids, urinalysis.
- ECG, echocardiography if cardiac involvement suspected.
- Workup for secondary causes if presentation atypical.

Treatment / Management:
- Lifestyle: Sodium restriction, weight loss, regular exercise, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation, stress reduction.
- Pharmacologic: First-line – ACE inhibitors (lisinopril), ARBs (losartan), thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), calcium channel blockers (amlodipine). Second-line/combination – Beta-blockers (metoprolol), aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone), loop diuretics if needed.
- Monitoring: Regular BP checks, renal function, electrolytes, adherence assessment.

Key Points:
Adequate BP control reduces cardiovascular and renal complications. 
Combination therapy is often required, and patient education is critical.
