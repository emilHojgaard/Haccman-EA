Document Information:
Disease - Spontaneous Pneumothorax
Date - 2024-07-20
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Overview:
Spontaneous pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing lung collapse. Nursing care emphasizes oxygenation, pain control, and drain system safety when used.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess acute pleuritic pain, dyspnea, and asymmetry of breath sounds. Review precipitating events and prior episodes; evaluate stability.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor SpOâ‚‚, respiratory effort, and chest pain. If a drain is placed, check for bubbling/air leak, water seal level, and subcutaneous emphysema.

Nursing Interventions:
Provide oxygen per orders, optimize analgesia, and assist with needle aspiration or chest drain setup using sterile technique. Keep the system below chest level and ensure secure connections.

Patient Education:
Educate on avoiding valsalva/strain and when to seek urgent care for sudden dyspnea. Discuss air travel and diving restrictions until cleared.

When to Escalate:
Escalate immediately for tension signs: severe distress, hypotension, or tracheal deviation. Notify respiratory or surgical teams for persistent air leak.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record respiratory status, drain details, and analgesia effectiveness. Coordinate surgical follow-up for recurrence risk.

Prognosis:
Primary cases often resolve with simple measures; recurrence is possible. Nursing drain care reduces complications.
