TITLE: Osteoarthritis (Knee/Hand/Hip)

Overview:
Osteoarthritis is “wear and repair” joint disease involving cartilage thinning, bone remodeling, and low-grade inflammation, causing pain and stiffness.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Age, prior joint injury, obesity, repetitive use
- Family history; malalignment (knee varus/valgus)

Common Symptoms:
- Activity-related joint pain, short morning stiffness
- Crepitus, swelling, reduced range of motion

Diagnosis:
- Clinical; X-rays for joint space narrowing, osteophytes
- Rule out inflammatory arthritis if red flags

Treatment:
- Exercise and weight reduction; physiotherapy (strengthening)
- Topical NSAIDs; intermittent oral analgesics
- Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for flares; surgery for severe disease

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Low-impact exercise (cycling, swimming), pacing activities
- Heat/cold therapy, braces or walking aids if needed

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Hot, very swollen joint (exclude infection/gout)
- Rapid deterioration in function

Prognosis:
Symptoms fluctuate over years; active management maintains mobility and quality of life.
