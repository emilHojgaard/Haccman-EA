Disease - Spontaneous Pneumothorax
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Purpose:
Outline recognition and acute management of primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Scope:
For emergency, respiratory, and ICU teams managing adults with acute pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea.

Indications:
Sudden unilateral pleuritic pain and breathlessness, sometimes after coughing or exertion; risk increased in tall thin individuals and underlying lung disease.

Diagnosis:
Confirm with chest radiography or ultrasound; use CT when findings are equivocal or to evaluate underlying disease. Estimate size and assess stability to guide intervention.

Treatment/Management:
Observe small, stable primary pneumothoraces with oxygen and follow-up; perform needle aspiration or place a chest drain for larger, symptomatic, or secondary cases. Treat tension pneumothorax with immediate needle decompression followed by definitive management.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for air leak and lung re-expansion; ensure analgesia and educate on recurrence prevention. Plan surgical referral for recurrent episodes or persistent air leak.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for tension physiology, hemodynamic instability, or refractory hypoxemia. Involve thoracic surgery for complicated or recurrent disease.

Safety Notes:
Avoid high-pressure ventilation where possible and counsel against air travel or diving until radiographic resolution and clearance. Use sterile technique for pleural procedures to reduce infection risk.
