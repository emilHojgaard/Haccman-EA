Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Definition:
Chronic metabolic disorder with hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.

Epidemiology:
Increasing global prevalence, especially in adults over 40. Risk factors include obesity, 
sedentary lifestyle, age, ethnicity, and family history.

Pathophysiology:
Peripheral insulin resistance combined with progressive beta-cell dysfunction results in elevated blood glucose. 
Hepatic gluconeogenesis is increased, contributing to hyperglycemia. 
Chronic hyperglycemia causes microvascular and macrovascular complications.

Clinical Features:
Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, blurred vision. Often asymptomatic for years. 
Chronic complications include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased cardiovascular risk.

Investigations:
- Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance test.
- Lipid profile, renal function, urine microalbumin.
- Periodic eye exams for retinopathy.

Treatment / Management:
- Lifestyle: Diet modification, weight management, physical activity, smoking cessation.
- Pharmacologic: Metformin first-line; other oral agents include sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists. Insulin therapy for uncontrolled hyperglycemia or advanced disease.
- Monitoring: HbA1c every 3â€“6 months, kidney function, lipid profile, blood pressure, foot exams.

Key Points:
Tight glycemic control prevents microvascular complications. 
Cardiovascular risk management and lifestyle adherence are essential.
