Disease - Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED Unit

Purpose:
Provide a risk-adapted strategy for diagnosing and treating suspected pulmonary embolism.

Scope:
For adult patients in emergency and inpatient care with acute dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or syncope where PE is a consideration.

Indications:
Sudden dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, or unexplained hypoxemia, particularly with immobilization, surgery, cancer, or prior VTE.

Diagnosis:
Apply clinical probability tools and D-dimer to guide imaging; use CTPA or V/Q scanning when appropriate. Assess right ventricular strain with biomarkers and echocardiography in intermediate or high risk.

Treatment/Management:
Start anticoagulation when suspicion is high and bleeding risk acceptable; consider thrombolysis or catheter therapy for high-risk PE with shock. Provide oxygen and treat underlying provoking factors.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor hemodynamics, oxygenation, and bleeding while on anticoagulation; plan duration based on provoked versus unprovoked events. Educate on recurrence risk and activity resumption.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hemodynamic instability, rising troponin/BNP with RV dysfunction, or persistent severe hypoxemia. Involve PE response teams for advanced therapies.

Safety Notes:
Verify renal function and weight for anticoagulant dosing and check for drug interactions. Evaluate pregnancy status before imaging and anticoagulant selection.
