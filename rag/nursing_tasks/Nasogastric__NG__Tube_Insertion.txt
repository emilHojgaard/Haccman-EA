Purpose:
Provide access for gastric decompression or feeding while minimizing aspiration and mucosal injury. Confirm placement safely before use.

For nurses trained in NG tube placement in adults under local policy. Additional confirmation requirements may apply for feeding use.

Indications:
Gastric decompression for obstruction/ileus, medication administration, or enteral feeding when oral intake is unsafe.

Contraindications:
Suspected basal skull fracture, severe facial trauma, or esophageal varices without senior approval. Caution in coagulopathy and altered anatomy.

Equipment:
Appropriate NG tube, lubricant, pH indicator strips, syringe, tape/securement, PPE, glass of water with straw if allowed.

Procedure Steps:
Explain and measure NEX distance, lubricate, and insert with neck flexion; advance during swallowing if safe. Verify placement by aspirate pH (â‰¤5.5) and per policy; secure tube and document.

Monitoring & Documentation:
Document size, nostril, insertion depth, and placement check. Monitor for coughing, respiratory distress, migration, or skin breakdown.

Patient/Family Education:
Explain the purpose of the tube, discomfort expectations, and the need to avoid pulling. Describe how feeding or decompression works.

Escalation:
Stop and escalate if respiratory distress, persistent coughing, or malposition suspected. Obtain imaging confirmation per local policy when required.

Safety Notes:
Never rely on auscultation alone for placement. Recheck position after episodes of coughing, vomiting, or repositioning.
