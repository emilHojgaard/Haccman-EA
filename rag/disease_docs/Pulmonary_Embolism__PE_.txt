Document Information:
Disease - Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
Date - 2023-12-15
Responsible Department - Respiratory/ED

Overview:
A PE is a blood clot in the lungs that blocks blood flow and lowers oxygen. It can be life-threatening and needs prompt treatment.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Clots often come from leg veins after immobility, surgery, pregnancy, cancer, or hormone therapy. Prior clots increase risk.

Common Symptoms:
Sudden shortness of breath, sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths, cough, or coughing up blood. Some people faint.

Diagnosis:
Doctors use risk scores, blood tests, and imaging such as a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. Heart strain is checked with tests.

Treatment:
Blood thinners prevent the clot from growing and new clots from forming. Severe cases may need clot-busting drugs or procedures.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Take anticoagulants exactly as prescribed and avoid activities that increase bleeding risk. Stay active and follow travel precautions.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Call emergency services for sudden breathlessness, chest pain, or fainting. Seek help for any heavy bleeding while on blood thinners.

Prognosis:
Most people improve over weeks to months. Long-term treatment depends on whether the clot was provoked and personal risk.
