Purpose:
Coordinate risk reduction, progression slowing, and complication management in adults with chronic kidney disease.

Scope:
For outpatient management with periodic inpatient consultation for complications.

Indications:
Reduced eGFR or persistent albuminuria on repeated testing, often with diabetes, hypertension, or vascular disease.

Diagnosis:
Stage CKD by eGFR and albuminuria and evaluate secondary causes where suspected; review medications and nephrotoxins. Screen for anemia, mineral bone disease, and acidosis.

Treatment/Management:
Optimize blood pressure, glycemic control, and RAAS blockade when appropriate; consider SGLT2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal MRAs in eligible patients. Avoid nephrotoxins and adjust doses by kidney function.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Track eGFR, albuminuria, potassium, and hemoglobin; vaccinate per risk and plan dialysis access discussions if progression continues. Coordinate nutrition and cardiovascular risk reduction.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapid eGFR decline, refractory hyperkalemia, fluid overload, or uremic symptoms. Refer for advanced planning or transplant evaluation when appropriate.

Safety Notes:
Monitor for hyperkalemia after medication changes and ensure contrast studies use renal-safe strategies. Educate on over-the-counter NSAID avoidance.
