Disease - Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEMI/Unstable Angina)
Date - 2023-10-09
Responsible Department - Cardiology

Overview:
This condition happens when a heart artery is partly blocked, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. It can cause chest pain and increase the risk of a heart attack.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Buildup of cholesterol plaque in the arteries is the main cause. Smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and family history raise risk.

Common Symptoms:
Chest pressure or tightness that may spread to the arm, neck, jaw, or back. Shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea can occur.

Diagnosis:
ECGs and blood tests for heart damage (troponins) help confirm the problem. Doctors also assess overall risk to guide treatment.

Treatment:
Medicines that thin the blood and reduce strain on the heart are started quickly. Many people need a heart catheter test and possibly a stent.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Stop smoking, take medicines as prescribed, and attend cardiac rehab. Focus on diet, exercise, and stress management.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Call emergency services for chest pain lasting more than a few minutes, especially with sweating or breathlessness. Do not drive yourself.

Prognosis:
Prompt treatment lowers the risk of heart damage and future events. Long-term success depends on risk-factor control.
