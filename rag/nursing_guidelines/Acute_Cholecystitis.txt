Overview:
Acute cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation from cystic duct obstruction. Nursing care emphasizes analgesia, antibiotics, and preparation for early surgery.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess right upper quadrant pain, fever, and Murphy sign; note nausea and vomiting. Review past gallstone events and comorbidities.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor vitals, pain control, and liver tests when available. Watch for cholangitis signs such as jaundice or hypotension.

Nursing Interventions:
Maintain NPO, start IV fluids and antibiotics as ordered, and manage analgesia. Prepare for laparoscopic cholecystectomy or drainage in high-risk patients.

Patient Education:
Explain procedure expectations, fasting rationale, and postoperative care. Discuss diet advancement and wound care.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for sepsis, uncontrolled pain, or suspected perforation. Alert the team for worsening jaundice or hypotension.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record antibiotic timing, pain scores, and surgical plans. Coordinate imaging and OR transfer.

Prognosis:
Timely surgery usually resolves symptoms. Nursing support prevents dehydration and delays to treatment.
