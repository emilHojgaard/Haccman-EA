Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Neurology Unit

Overview:
TIA is transient neurological deficit resolving within 24 h, warning of high early stroke risk. Nursing focus: rapid triage, risk stratification, education, and secondary prevention adherence.

Nursing Assessment:
- Symptom description/timing; vascular risk factors; AF history.
- Neuro status baseline, vitals, glucose.

Key Monitoring:
- Recurrent symptoms, BP, adherence to antiplatelet/anticoag (if AF), statins.

Nursing Interventions:
- Educate on urgent presentation if symptoms recur; medication adherence.
- Coordinate carotid/cardiac investigations as ordered.

Patient Education:
- FAST recognition; smoking cessation, diet/activity; BP/glucose control.

When to Escalate:
- New neuro deficits at any time → emergency pathway.

Documentation & Coordination:
- Events, education, meds given; arrange follow-up with TIA/stroke clinic.

Prognosis:
High early stroke risk without prevention; nursing education reduces recurrence.
