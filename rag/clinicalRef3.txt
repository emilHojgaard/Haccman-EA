Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Definition:
Progressive airflow limitation caused by chronic inflammation, most often related to smoking or environmental exposure.

Epidemiology:
Adults over 40 are most affected. Major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
Smoking is the predominant risk factor.

Pathophysiology:
Chronic inflammation leads to airway remodeling, alveolar destruction, and mucus hypersecretion. 
Exacerbations are frequently triggered by infections or pollutants.

Clinical Features:
Chronic productive cough, dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, fatigue. 
Exacerbations include increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath.

Investigations:
- Spirometry (FEV1/FVC <0.7) for diagnosis and staging.
- Chest X-ray or CT to evaluate complications.
- Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas as needed.

Treatment / Management:
- Lifestyle: Smoking cessation, vaccination (influenza, pneumococcal), pulmonary rehabilitation.
- Pharmacologic: Bronchodilators â€“ SABA (salbutamol), LABA (salmeterol), LAMA (tiotropium); inhaled corticosteroids for select patients. 
  Acute exacerbation therapy: oral corticosteroids, antibiotics if bacterial infection suspected.
- Monitoring: Symptoms, lung function, exacerbation frequency, oxygen saturation.

Key Points:
Preventing exacerbations improves quality of life and reduces hospitalizations.
