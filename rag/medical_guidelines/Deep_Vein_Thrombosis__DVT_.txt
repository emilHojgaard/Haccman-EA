Purpose:
Standardize evaluation and anticoagulation of suspected lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis.

Scope:
For adults with leg swelling or pain in ambulatory and emergency settings.

Indications:
Unilateral leg swelling, pain, warmth, and dilated superficial veins, often after immobility, trauma, or surgery.

Diagnosis:
Use clinical probability scoring with D-dimer to decide on compression ultrasonography. Consider alternative diagnoses like cellulitis or Bakerâ€™s cyst.

Treatment/Management:
Initiate anticoagulation when indicated and choose agent based on renal function, cancer status, and preferences. Encourage ambulation as tolerated and compression for symptoms.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for bleeding and extension; review adherence and duration strategy. Reassess provoking factors and need for thrombophilia testing in selected patients.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for extensive iliofemoral thrombosis, phlegmasia, or suspected PE. Seek specialty input for thrombolysis or thrombectomy in limb-threatening cases.

Safety Notes:
Adjust dosing in renal impairment and avoid drug interactions that increase bleeding. Educate on warning signs of PE during treatment.
