Disease - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) â€“ New Onset
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Cardiology Unit

Purpose:
Offer a consistent approach to rate or rhythm control and thromboembolism prevention in new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Scope:
Applies to emergency and inpatient settings for adults presenting with AF with rapid ventricular response or symptomatic palpitations.

Indications:
Palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, fatigue, or incidental irregularly irregular rhythm on exam or ECG.

Diagnosis:
Confirm with ECG and classify duration and hemodynamic stability; evaluate triggers such as infection, thyrotoxicosis, or alcohol. Calculate stroke risk and bleeding risk to guide anticoagulation.

Treatment/Management:
Stabilize if unstable, then pursue rate control and consider rhythm control based on symptoms and duration. Initiate anticoagulation when indicated and address reversible contributors.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor rate, symptoms, and anticoagulation parameters; educate on recurrence and device monitoring options. Plan outpatient rhythm assessment and risk factor modification.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for hypotension, ischemia, heart failure, or pre-excited AF with very rapid conduction. Seek urgent cardiology input for cardioversion timing and anticoagulation strategy.

Safety Notes:
Review drug interactions with anticoagulants and rate-controlling agents. Avoid AV nodal blockers in pre-excited AF until WPW is excluded.
