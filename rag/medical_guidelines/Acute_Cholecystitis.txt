Purpose:
Guide timely diagnosis and surgical planning for acute inflammation of the gallbladder, typically due to cystic duct obstruction.

Scope:
Applies to adults with right upper quadrant pain presenting to emergency or surgical services.

Indications:
Steady right upper quadrant pain with fever, leukocytosis, and positive Murphy sign; nausea and vomiting are common.

Diagnosis:
Use abdominal ultrasound as initial imaging to identify stones, wall thickening, and sonographic Murphy sign; consider HIDA scan if equivocal. Evaluate severity and suitability for early surgery.

Treatment/Management:
Provide analgesia, fluids, and antibiotics targeting biliary flora; arrange early laparoscopic cholecystectomy when feasible. Use percutaneous cholecystostomy for high-risk surgical candidates.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor fever curve, liver tests, and pain control; watch for biliary obstruction or perforation. Plan outpatient follow-up for pathology and risk factor modification.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for sepsis, gallbladder gangrene, or perforation. Seek advanced support for cholangitis or choledocholithiasis.

Safety Notes:
Screen for antibiotic allergies and adjust dosing in renal or hepatic impairment. Employ DVT prophylaxis perioperatively based on risk.
