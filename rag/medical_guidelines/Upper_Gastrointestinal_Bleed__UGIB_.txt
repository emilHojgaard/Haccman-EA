Disease - Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed (UGIB)
Date - 2025-03-22
Responsible Department - Gastroenterology

Purpose:
Standardize resuscitation, risk stratification, and endoscopic coordination for suspected upper GI bleeding.

Scope:
For emergency and inpatient settings evaluating hematemesis, melena, or anemia suggestive of UGIB.

Indications:
Hematemesis, melena, syncope, or symptomatic anemia often due to peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, or varices.

Diagnosis:
Assess hemodynamics, labs, and risk scores; consider nasogastric aspirate selectively. Identify anticoagulant use and comorbid liver disease.

Treatment/Management:
Resuscitate with fluids and blood as indicated; start proton pump inhibitors and coordinate early endoscopy. Use vasoactive drugs and antibiotics for suspected variceal bleeding.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor vitals, hemoglobin, and recurrent bleeding; adjust anticoagulants and plan secondary prophylaxis. Arrange H. pylori testing and eradication where relevant.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for persistent hemodynamic instability, rebleeding, or suspected varices. Involve interventional radiology or surgery for refractory bleeding.

Safety Notes:
Avoid over-transfusion in stable patients and correct coagulopathy thoughtfully. Document timing of last anticoagulant dose and reversal where indicated.
