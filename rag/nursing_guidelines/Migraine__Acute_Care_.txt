Responsible Department - Neurology

Overview:
Migraine produces recurrent, disabling headaches with sensory symptoms. Nursing care reduces stimuli, administers abortive therapy, and prevents medication overuse.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess aura, photophobia/phonophobia, nausea, and triggers. Screen for red flags suggesting secondary causes.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor pain scores, hydration, and response to therapy. Track adverse effects from triptans, antiemetics, or NSAIDs.

Nursing Interventions:
Provide a low-stimulus environment, administer prescribed analgesics and antiemetics, and encourage sleep hygiene. Offer non-pharmacologic measures like hydration and cold packs.

Patient Education:
Teach trigger tracking, limits on acute medications, and preventive options discussion. Provide headache diary templates.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for status migrainosus, new neurological deficits, or atypical features. Seek specialist input for refractory attacks.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document onset, treatments, and response trajectory. Coordinate outpatient neurology referral when frequent.

Prognosis:
Most episodes resolve with appropriate therapy. Nursing education curbs rebound headaches.
