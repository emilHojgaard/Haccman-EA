Overview:
Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that causes fever, aches, and cough. It spreads easily during seasonal outbreaks.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Flu viruses spread by droplets. Young children, older adults, pregnant people, and those with chronic disease are at higher risk.

Common Symptoms:
Sudden fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, cough, and tiredness.

Diagnosis:
Doctors often diagnose by symptoms during flu season; a rapid test may confirm it when it changes management.

Treatment:
Most people recover with rest and fluids; antivirals may be offered early to high-risk patients. Pain relievers ease discomfort.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Stay home to avoid spreading infection, cover coughs, and wash hands. Annual vaccination is the best prevention.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek care for breathing difficulties, chest pain, persistent high fever, or if symptoms suddenly worsen after initial improvement.

Prognosis:
Symptoms usually improve within a week, though cough and fatigue may linger. Complications are more likely in high-risk groups.
