TITLE: Peripheral IV Cannulation (PVC) Insertion – Nursing Clinical Guideline
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-09-30
Responsible Department: Medical Ward / Infection Medicine

Purpose:
Provide standardized steps for safe insertion, securement, and initial care of a peripheral venous catheter (PVC) in adults.

Scope:
Applies to registered nurses trained and authorized in PVC insertion in ward, ED, day-case, or outpatient settings.

Indications:
- Short-term IV access for medications, fluids, or contrast
- Temporary access while awaiting central access

Contraindications:
- Severe local infection/dermatitis at intended site
- Lymphoedema or limb with AV fistula / prior axillary node dissection
- Anticipated vesicants or high-osmolar infusions (>900 mOsm/L) → consider central access

Equipment:
- PVC kit (appropriate gauge), tourniquet, antiseptic (chlorhexidine/alcohol)
- Sterile gloves, sterile transparent dressing, stabilization device
- 0.9% saline flush, extension set / needle-free connector, sharps container, labels

Procedure Steps:
- Perform hand hygiene and don PPE; verify patient identity and allergies; explain procedure.
- Select site (forearm preferred); avoid areas of flexion if possible.
- Apply tourniquet; palpate a suitable vein; cleanse site with antiseptic and allow to dry.
- Insert catheter at 15–30° until flashback; advance cannula, withdraw needle; dispose sharps safely.
- Attach extension; aspirate/flush to confirm patency; secure with sterile dressing and stabilization device.
- Label dressing (date/time/gauge/initials). Document site, gauge, attempts, and patient tolerance.

Monitoring & Documentation:
- Check site at least once per shift for phlebitis, infiltration, leakage, and securement.
- Maintain closed system; change dressing if compromised; flush per protocol.
- Remove PVC when no longer indicated or if complications develop. Document findings and actions.

Patient Education:
- Report pain, heat, swelling, leakage, or restricted movement.
- Keep site clean/dry; avoid pulling on tubing.

Escalation:
- Signs of infiltration/extravasation, phlebitis, purulence, inability to flush → stop infusion; re-site; notify prescriber.
- Recurrent failures or prolonged therapy anticipated → consider central access.

Safety Notes:
- Aseptic non-touch technique; allow antiseptic to dry fully.
- Use the smallest gauge that meets therapy needs; minimize attempts.
