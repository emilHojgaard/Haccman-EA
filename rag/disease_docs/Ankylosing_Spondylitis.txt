TITLE: Ankylosing Spondylitis

Overview:
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing back pain and stiffness that improves with activity.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- HLA-B27 genetic association; family history
- Young adult onset, male predominance

Common Symptoms:
- Inflammatory back pain (night pain, morning stiffness >30 minutes)
- Reduced spinal flexibility; heel pain, uveitis

Diagnosis:
- Clinical features, elevated inflammatory markers
- MRI of sacroiliac joints; HLA-B27 testing supports
- Exclude mechanical back pain

Treatment:
- NSAIDs first-line; exercise and posture training
- Biologic agents (TNF/IL-17 inhibitors) for active disease
- Manage extra-articular features (eye care for uveitis)

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Daily stretching and strengthening; avoid smoking
- Ergonomic adjustments and sleep positioning

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Visual symptoms (uveitis), progressive stiffness, uncontrolled pain

Prognosis:
Varies; biologics have transformed outcomes and function.
