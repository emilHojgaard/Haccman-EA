Purpose:
Offer a structured pathway for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment selection for major depressive disorder.

Scope:
For primary care and behavioral health settings managing adults with persistent low mood or anhedonia.

Indications:
At least two weeks of depressed mood or anhedonia with changes in sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, or self-worth; consider comorbid anxiety or substance use.

Diagnosis:
Use validated screening tools and clinical interview to confirm criteria; assess suicide risk and medical contributors such as thyroid disease or medications.

Treatment/Management:
Provide psychoeducation and choose psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or combined approaches based on severity and preference. Address sleep, exercise, and substance use, and plan for measurement-based care.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor symptom scores, adherence, and side effects; adjust therapy at regular intervals. Plan relapse prevention and maintenance strategies for recurrent episodes.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for active suicidal intent, psychosis, catatonia, or failure of multiple treatments. Coordinate urgent evaluation and higher levels of care as needed.

Safety Notes:
Discuss black-box warnings and initiation side effects; review pregnancy and lactation considerations. Avoid abrupt discontinuation of serotonergic agents.
