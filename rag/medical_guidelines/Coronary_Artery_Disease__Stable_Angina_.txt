Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-15
Responsible Department: Cardiology Unit

1. Purpose
Direct evaluation and medical optimization of stable angina.

2. Scope
Ambulatory and ward settings.

3. Indications
Exertional chest pressure relieved by rest/nitroglycerin.

4. Diagnosis
- Pretest probability; ECG; functional imaging or CTCA as indicated.
- Risk stratification for revascularization.

5. Treatment/Management
- Antianginal: beta-blocker ± CCB/nitrates; consider ranolazine.
- Secondary prevention: statin (high-intensity), antiplatelet (aspirin), ACEi/ARB for HTN/DM; lifestyle.

6. Monitoring & Follow-up
- Symptom burden, nitrate use; lipid/BP/glucose targets.

7. When to Escalate
- Crescendo/rest angina, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmia.

8. Safety Notes
- Nitrate interactions (PDE-5 inhibitors).
