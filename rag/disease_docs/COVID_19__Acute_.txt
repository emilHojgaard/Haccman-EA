Overview:
COVID-19 is a viral infection that ranges from mild cold-like illness to serious lung disease. Some people develop low oxygen levels and need hospital care.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Close contact with an infected person spreads the virus. Older age, chronic illness, and weak immunity raise risk for severe disease.

Common Symptoms:
Fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, loss of smell or taste, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

Diagnosis:
Rapid antigen or PCR tests confirm infection. Doctors may check oxygen levels and order imaging if symptoms are severe.

Treatment:
Rest, fluids, and fever control help in mild cases. Higher-risk patients may receive antivirals or oxygen depending on symptoms.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Follow isolation and mask guidance when contagious. Stay hydrated and monitor symptoms; use a pulse oximeter if advised.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek urgent care for chest pain, trouble breathing, confusion, or oxygen levels below guidance. Call emergency services if symptoms escalate quickly.

Prognosis:
Most recover fully, though some experience prolonged symptoms. Vaccination lowers the risk of severe illness.
