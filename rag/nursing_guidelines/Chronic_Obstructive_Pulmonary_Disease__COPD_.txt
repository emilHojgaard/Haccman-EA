Document Information:
Disease - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Date - 2024-11-13
Responsible Department - Pulmonology Unit

Overview:
COPD involves persistent airflow limitation with symptom burden and exacerbation risk. Nursing care focuses on dyspnea relief, safe oxygen delivery, infection surveillance, and inhaler optimization.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess baseline function, activity tolerance, and exacerbation history. Evaluate cough, sputum purulence, accessory muscle use, and pursed-lip breathing; note home oxygen or NIV use.

Key Monitoring:
Track SpO₂ with ordered targets and observe for CO₂ retention signs such as drowsiness or tremor. Monitor frequency of rescue inhaler use and response to therapy.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer prescribed bronchodilators and systemic steroids when indicated; provide controlled oxygen to avoid hypercapnia. Encourage effective coughing, airway clearance, and energy conservation techniques.

Patient Education:
Reinforce vaccination, smoking cessation support, and inhaler technique with demonstration and return-demo. Teach early exacerbation recognition and when to seek care.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rising CO₂, worsening hypoxemia, or increasing work of breathing despite therapy. Notify the team for altered mental status or hemodynamic instability.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record ABG results, oxygen settings, and therapy responses. Coordinate pulmonary rehab referrals and community follow-up for inhaler supply and adherence.

Prognosis:
Prognosis depends on severity and exacerbation control; pulmonary rehab improves function. Nursing support reduces readmissions and enhances self-management.
