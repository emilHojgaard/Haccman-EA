Overview:
Acute pyelonephritis is a systemic urinary tract infection affecting the renal parenchyma. Nursing care supports timely antibiotics, hydration, and pain control.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess fever, flank pain, CVA tenderness, and urinary symptoms. Review pregnancy status, obstruction risk, and recent instrumentation.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor temperature curve, renal function, and response to therapy. Track hydration status and nausea control.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer empiric antibiotics promptly and ensure adequate fluids; provide analgesia and antiemetics. Prepare for imaging if obstruction is suspected.

Patient Education:
Reinforce antibiotic adherence, hydration, and early return if symptoms persist. Discuss UTI prevention strategies.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for sepsis, persistent fever after therapy initiation, or obstruction signs. Seek urgent urologic input for hydronephrosis.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document antibiotic start time, vitals, and symptom changes. Coordinate follow-up cultures in high-risk cases.

Prognosis:
Most patients improve within days of therapy. Nursing hydration and adherence coaching reduce recurrence.
