Document Information:
Disease - Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
Date - 2025-01-04
Responsible Department - Endocrinology Unit

Overview:
DKA is a hyperglycemic emergency with ketonemia and acidosis. Nursing priorities are fluid resuscitation, insulin protocol adherence, and electrolyte safety.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess dehydration, Kussmaul respirations, abdominal pain, and mental status. Review possible triggers such as infection or insulin omission.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor glucose, ketones, electrolytes (especially potassium), anion gap, and urine output. Track vitals closely for perfusion changes.

Nursing Interventions:
Start isotonic fluids per protocol, ensure potassium is safe before insulin, and initiate insulin infusion as ordered. Prevent hypoglycemia and replace electrolytes guided by labs.

Patient Education:
Teach sick-day rules, ketone testing, hydration, and when to seek urgent care. Review insulin storage, dosing, and adherence tools.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for refractory acidosis, altered consciousness, or shock. Seek ICU review for frequent titration needs or severe comorbidity.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document fluid volumes, insulin rates, lab trends, and responses. Coordinate diabetes education before discharge.

Prognosis:
Outcomes are excellent with timely protocol use. Nursing precision prevents electrolyte injury and hypoglycemia.
