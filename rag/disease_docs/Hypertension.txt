TITLE: Hypertension

Overview:
Hypertension is persistently elevated blood pressure that increases strain on the heart and arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and heart failure. Many people have no symptoms and learn of it during routine checks.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Ageing, family history, high-salt diet, obesity, inactivity
- Alcohol excess, stress, sleep apnea
- Secondary causes (kidney disease, endocrine disorders, certain medications)

Common Symptoms:
- Often none; sometimes headaches or dizziness with severe elevations
- Long-term uncontrolled BP can damage organs silently

Diagnosis:
- Repeated BP measurements (office and/or ambulatory/home monitoring)
- Evaluation for target-organ effects and secondary causes
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (lipids, glucose)

Treatment:
- Lifestyle: salt reduction, weight loss, regular exercise, limit alcohol
- First-line medications: ACE inhibitor/ARB, calcium channel blocker, thiazide-like diuretic (alone or in combination)
- Add agents stepwise to reach target BP

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Home BP monitoring and log
- Heart-healthy diet (e.g., DASH/Mediterranean)
- Stress reduction, good sleep, smoking cessation

When to Seek Medical Help:
- BP â‰¥180/120 mmHg with chest pain, breathlessness, neuro symptoms (emergency)
- Persistent high readings despite medication

Prognosis:
Most achieve targets with combined lifestyle and medication, substantially reducing cardiovascular risk.
