Chief Complaint:
Birgit Andersen reports fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and occasional lightheadedness.

History of Present Illness:
Birgit Andersen notes weeks of progressive tiredness and exertional dyspnea. Diet is low in iron-rich foods; denies obvious bleeding but reports intermittent dyspepsia with NSAID use. No black stools observed at home.

Physical Examination:
Pale conjunctivae; soft systolic flow murmur; no focal deficits. Vitals stable (BP 135/68 mmHg, HR 64 bpm). Abdomen soft, non-tender.

Diagnostics (Today):
Hb low with microcytosis, low ferritin, and reduced transferrin saturation. Stool testing and GI evaluation considered if no dietary cause identified.

Assessment:
Microcytic anemia most consistent with iron deficiency; source evaluation warranted (dietary vs occult GI blood loss).

Plan:
- Start oral iron with vitamin C; discuss GI side effects and adherence strategies (alternate-day dosing if needed).
- Review NSAID exposure and consider gastroprotection or alternatives.
- Arrange GI work-up if poor response or red flags emerge (e.g., melena, weight loss).

Patient Education & Safety Net:
Explain expected timeline for symptom improvement and iron store repletion. Advise on iron-rich foods and to seek care for black stools, severe dizziness, or chest pain.

Follow-up & Disposition:
Recheck Hb and ferritin in 7 weeks; earlier review if symptoms worsen.
