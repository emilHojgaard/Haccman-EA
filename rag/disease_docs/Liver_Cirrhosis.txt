TITLE: Liver Cirrhosis

Overview:
Cirrhosis is advanced liver scarring from chronic injury (e.g., alcohol, viral hepatitis, NASH). It can lead to portal hypertension and liver failure.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Alcohol-related liver disease, chronic hepatitis B/C
- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune or cholestatic diseases

Common Symptoms:
- Fatigue, easy bruising, ankle swelling, abdominal distension (ascites)
- Jaundice, confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) in advanced stages

Diagnosis:
- Abnormal liver tests, ultrasound/elastography for fibrosis
- Endoscopy to screen for varices; rule out HCC with imaging/AFP

Treatment:
- Address cause (alcohol cessation, antivirals)
- Diuretics for ascites; lactulose for encephalopathy; variceal prophylaxis
- Vaccinations and nutrition support; transplant evaluation in decompensation

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Strict alcohol abstinence; low-salt diet for ascites
- Medication adherence and infection vigilance

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Increasing abdominal girth, confusion, vomiting blood, black stools, fever

Prognosis:
Depends on cause and stage; early management and abstinence slow progression, advanced disease may require transplant.
