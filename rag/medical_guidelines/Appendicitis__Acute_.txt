Purpose:
Provide a structured approach to diagnosing and managing acute appendicitis including operative and nonoperative pathways.

Scope:
For adult and adolescent patients in emergency and surgical services with suspected right lower quadrant pain.

Indications:
Periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant with anorexia, nausea, and localized tenderness; fever may be present.

Diagnosis:
Use clinical scoring to guide imaging selection; perform ultrasound or CT depending on availability and patient factors. Evaluate for complications such as perforation or abscess.

Treatment/Management:
Offer appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis or consider antibiotics in selected cases after shared decision-making. Provide perioperative antibiotics and fluid management.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Monitor for postoperative infection, ileus, and pain control; advance diet as tolerated. Arrange follow-up for pathology review and recurrence counseling after nonoperative care.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for peritonitis, sepsis, or failure of nonoperative management. Consult interventional radiology for drainable abscesses.

Safety Notes:
Assess pregnancy status before imaging and surgery planning. Review allergies before antibiotics and apply DVT prophylaxis per risk.
