Purpose:
Ensure rapid recognition and first-line treatment of anaphylaxis with intramuscular epinephrine.

Scope:
For prehospital and emergency clinicians managing acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions.

Indications:
Acute onset of skin or mucosal symptoms with respiratory compromise, hypotension, or gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to a likely allergen.

Diagnosis:
Make a clinical diagnosis based on compatible features and timing; do not delay treatment for confirmatory testing. Identify triggers such as foods, medications, or stings.

Treatment/Management:
Administer intramuscular epinephrine promptly and repeat if needed; provide airway support, oxygen, and IV fluids. Add antihistamines and corticosteroids as adjuncts after epinephrine.

Monitoring & Follow-up:
Observe for biphasic reactions and ensure access to self-injectable epinephrine on discharge. Arrange allergy referral for trigger evaluation and action plan.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for airway compromise, refractory hypotension, or severe bronchospasm requiring advanced airway or vasopressors. Involve critical care for persistent instability.

Safety Notes:
Epinephrine is first-line; avoid delaying its use. Review beta-blocker therapy which may blunt responses and consider glucagon in refractory cases.
