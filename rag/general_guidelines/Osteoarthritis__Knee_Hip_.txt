Overview:
Osteoarthritis is wear-and-tear arthritis that affects joint cartilage and surrounding bone. It can limit mobility and daily activities.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Age, previous injury, excess weight, and family history increase risk. Physically demanding work may contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Joint pain that worsens with activity, stiffness after rest, and grinding or clicking. Swelling may occur.

Diagnosis:
Doctors assess symptoms and exam; X-rays may show joint space loss and bone spurs.

Treatment:
Exercise therapy, weight management, and pain relievers help symptoms. Injections or joint replacement may be considered in advanced cases.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Strengthen supporting muscles, use heat/cold packs, and pace activities. Use canes or braces if recommended.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help for persistent pain, night pain, or sudden swelling and redness. Discuss options if activity becomes very limited.

Prognosis:
Symptoms often fluctuate; many people manage well with a combination of lifestyle measures and medicines.
