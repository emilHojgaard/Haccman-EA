Document Information:
Disease - Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEMI/UA)
Date - 2024-05-26
Responsible Department - Cardiology Unit

Overview:
NSTEMI/UA presents with ischemic chest discomfort without persistent ST elevation. Nursing care centers on pain relief, antithrombotic safety, and rapid deterioration detection.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess chest pain quality, radiation, and associated dyspnea or diaphoresis. Review risk factors, recent exertion, and medication history including anticoagulants.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor telemetry, vitals, and serial pain scores; track troponin draws and ECG timing. Observe for bleeding signs with antithrombotics.

Nursing Interventions:
Administer antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy as ordered and provide nitrates or beta-blockers when prescribed. Maintain IV access and prepare for imaging or catheterization.

Patient Education:
Explain the plan for monitoring, procedures, and medication effects. Reinforce activity restriction until cleared and risk-factor modification.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for recurrent chest pain, hypotension, arrhythmias, or new heart failure signs. Alert the interventional team for rapid changes.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document symptom onset times, ECGs, troponin results, and medications administered. Coordinate handover to cath lab or step-down with clear anticoagulant status.

Prognosis:
Early detection and therapy improve outcomes. Nursing vigilance reduces time to intervention and bleeding complications.
