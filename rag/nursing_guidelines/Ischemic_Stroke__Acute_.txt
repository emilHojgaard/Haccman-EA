Document Information:
Disease - Ischemic Stroke (Acute)
Date - 2023-09-16
Responsible Department - Neurology/Stroke Unit

Overview:
Acute ischemic stroke requires rapid imaging and reperfusion eligibility assessment. Nursing care focuses on airway protection, BP parameters, and prevention of complications.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess time last known well, focal deficits, glucose, and anticoagulant use. Screen for dysphagia before oral intake.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor neuro checks per protocol, BP targets, and temperature; watch for worsening deficits. Track thrombolysis or thrombectomy timelines if pursued.

Nursing Interventions:
Maintain head midline with aspiration precautions, and manage oxygenation. Prepare for thrombolysis screening, administer ordered meds, and start DVT prophylaxis when appropriate.

Patient Education:
Explain stroke symptoms, time sensitivity, and rehabilitation goals. Involve family in positioning and safety education.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for decreased level of consciousness, rising BP beyond parameters, or new severe headache. Notify the team for signs of hemorrhagic conversion.

Documentation & Coordination:
Document NIHSS or local scores, swallow screen, therapy times, and neuro trends. Coordinate PT/OT/SLT referrals and discharge planning early.

Prognosis:
Timely reperfusion and rehab improve function. Nursing complication prevention reduces pneumonia and DVT risk.
