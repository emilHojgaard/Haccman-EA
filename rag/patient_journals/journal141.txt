Assessment:
Manic episode consistent with bipolar affective disorder; safety risk present due to impulsivity.

- Initiate mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium with renal/thyroid monitoring) or atypical antipsychotic. Consider inpatient admission for stabilization if outpatient safety cannot be ensured. Coordinate psychoeducation with family.
- Follow-up in 2 weeks as appropriate.
