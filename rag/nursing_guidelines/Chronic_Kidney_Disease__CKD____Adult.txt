Disease - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) â€“ Adult
Date - 2025-09-20
Responsible Department - Nephrology

Overview:
CKD involves gradual loss of kidney function with systemic complications. Nursing care supports risk reduction, medication safety, and education on kidney-protective behaviors.

Nursing Assessment:
Assess eGFR trends, albuminuria, blood pressure control, and anemia symptoms. Review nephrotoxin exposure and fluid status.

Key Monitoring:
Monitor electrolytes, hemoglobin, and BP; ensure dose adjustments for renally cleared drugs. Track vaccination status.

Nursing Interventions:
Reinforce RAAS and SGLT2 adherence when prescribed, encourage hydration balance, and avoid NSAIDs. Provide nutrition counseling coordination.

Patient Education:
Teach sick-day rules, medication lists, and when to seek care for edema or dyspnea. Discuss dialysis options early if progression occurs.

When to Escalate:
Escalate for rapid eGFR decline, refractory hyperkalemia, or uremic symptoms. Refer for vascular access planning when indicated.

Documentation & Coordination:
Record lab trends, blood pressure logs, and education delivered. Coordinate nephrology visits and anemia management services.

Prognosis:
Progression varies; risk reduction slows decline. Nursing monitoring prevents medication-related harm.
