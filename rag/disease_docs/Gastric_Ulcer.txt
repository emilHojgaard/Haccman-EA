TITLE: Gastric Ulcer

Overview:
Gastric ulcers are sores in the stomach lining, most commonly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or NSAID use.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- H. pylori, NSAIDs/aspirin, smoking, alcohol excess
- Severe physiological stress (rare)

Common Symptoms:
- Epigastric pain/heartburn, nausea/bloating
- Pain can be meal-related; sometimes asymptomatic

Diagnosis:
- H. pylori testing (breath/stool/biopsy)
- Endoscopy to confirm ulcer and rule out cancer in at-risk groups
- CBC to assess for anemia

Treatment:
- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy
- Eradicate H. pylori if present (combination antibiotics + PPI)
- Stop NSAIDs or add gastroprotection if essential

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Avoid smoking, excess alcohol, and irritant foods
- Small frequent meals if helpful; adhere to therapy

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Vomiting blood/coffee-ground material, black stools, severe persistent pain
- Weight loss or difficulty swallowing

Prognosis:
Most ulcers heal with PPI and H. pylori eradication; relapse risk rises with ongoing NSAIDs or smoking.
