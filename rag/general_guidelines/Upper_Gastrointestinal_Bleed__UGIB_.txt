Disease - Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed (UGIB)
Date - 2024-11-28
Responsible Department - Gastroenterology

Overview:
UGIB means bleeding from the esophagus, stomach, or upper small intestine. It can be serious and needs urgent evaluation.

Causes and Risk Factors:
Common causes include ulcers, stomach irritation from medicines, and enlarged veins from liver disease. Alcohol and H. pylori infection contribute.

Common Symptoms:
Vomiting blood or coffee-ground material, black stools, weakness, and dizziness. Some people have chest or belly discomfort.

Diagnosis:
Doctors assess blood counts and perform an endoscopy to find and treat the source. Medicines reduce stomach acid.

Treatment:
Fluids and blood support may be needed. Endoscopy can seal bleeding vessels; specific treatments target the cause.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Avoid NSAIDs and limit alcohol. Take ulcer medicines as prescribed and complete H. pylori treatment if present.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek emergency care for vomiting blood, black stools, fainting, or severe weakness.

Prognosis:
Most bleeds can be controlled, but recurrence depends on the cause and risk factors.
