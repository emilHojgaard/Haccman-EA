TITLE: Chronic Kidney Disease

Overview:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is gradual loss of kidney function over months to years. Early stages often have no symptoms but increase risk of cardiovascular disease and kidney failure.

Causes and Risk Factors:
- Diabetes, hypertension (most common)
- Glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease
- Recurrent kidney infections or obstruction, nephrotoxic drugs

Common Symptoms:
- Often none until advanced; fatigue, ankle swelling, nocturia
- Nausea, poor appetite, itchy skin in later stages

Diagnosis:
- eGFR and serum creatinine trends; urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR)
- Blood pressure, electrolytes, bone/mineral profile
- Ultrasound if structural disease suspected

Treatment:
- Control diabetes and blood pressure (ACEi/ARB for albuminuria)
- SGLT2 inhibitors show renal/CV benefits in many patients
- Avoid nephrotoxins (NSAIDs), adjust drug doses to kidney function
- Manage anemia and bone-mineral disorders in advanced CKD

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
- Low-salt diet, weight management, exercise
- Medication adherence; blood pressure and glucose monitoring

When to Seek Medical Help:
- Rapid swelling, breathlessness, confusion, or severe electrolyte symptoms
- Rising creatinine or very abnormal potassium

Prognosis:
Progression can be slowed substantially with aggressive risk-factor control.
