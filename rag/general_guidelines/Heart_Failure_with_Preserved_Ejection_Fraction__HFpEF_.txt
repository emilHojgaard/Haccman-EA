Disease - Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
Date - 2024-09-09
Responsible Department - Cardiology

Overview:
HFpEF is a type of heart failure where the heart squeezes normally but is stiff and does not fill well. This leads to fluid buildup and breathlessness, especially with activity.

Causes and Risk Factors:
High blood pressure, older age, obesity, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation are common contributors. Sleep apnea and kidney disease also play a role.

Common Symptoms:
Shortness of breath with exertion, swollen ankles, and fatigue. Needing extra pillows at night is common.

Diagnosis:
An echocardiogram shows normal squeeze but signs of stiffness. Blood tests and a physical exam help assess fluid and rule out other causes.

Treatment:
Diuretics relieve fluid; other medicines target blood pressure, diabetes, and weight. Some patients benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors and treatment of sleep apnea.

Self-Management and Lifestyle:
Limit salt, monitor daily weight, and stay active within your limits. Track swelling and call if weight rises quickly.

When to Seek Medical Help:
Seek help for sudden weight gain, worsening breathlessness, chest pain, or fainting. Call urgently if you cannot lie flat due to breathlessness.

Prognosis:
Symptoms can be controlled and quality of life improved with careful management of risk factors.
